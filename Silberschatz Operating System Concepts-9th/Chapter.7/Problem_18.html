<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Proof using contradiction to show the system is deadlock free if the following two conditions hold:</p> <p> <b>Condition 1:</b> The max need of each process is between 1 and <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/media%2Fe81%2Fe819285b-3299-4f0d-a2dc-6ceab00a437f%2F13258-7-18E-i9.png" /> resources.</p> <p> <b>Condition 2:</b> The sum of all max needs is less than <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/media%2F218%2F21894a5c-1f21-4a87-80a3-01f219ec43cf%2F13258-7-18E-i10.png" />.</p> <p>Let, the system is not deadlock free.</p> <p>If there is deadlock in the system, then the sum of all allocations of processes is equal to the number of resources. </p> <p>That is, <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/media%2F84b%2F84b03caf-4b69-43da-a5b0-abd7fec69d5e%2F13258-7-18E-i11.png" />. </p> <p>This is because only one type of resource is present, and a process can request or release only one resource at a time.</p> <p>From condition 2, The sum of all max needs is less than <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/media%2Fe6c%2Fe6c9cba7-8c3e-4d2f-803d-e728618c7a44%2F13258-7-18E-i12.png" />. That is, </p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/media%2F0c3%2F0c397c64-7306-4042-b6ea-2a856bb031cd%2F13258-7-18E-i13.png" /> </p> <p>Therefore, <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/media%2F525%2F5255ff37-2d25-4b46-98ff-ebb18f8738fe%2F13258-7-18E-i14.png" />. That is, the sum of all needs of processes is less than the number of resources. Then, the need of at least one process is 1. That is <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/media%2Fad5%2Fad5b3a76-0853-4596-891e-69f8447d61ec%2F13258-7-18E-i15.png" />. This condition shows that there is no deadlock.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Form condition 1, the maximum need of each process is between 1 and <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/media%2F7bf%2F7bf760b1-9fed-4d83-8d1d-6fa072b8852e%2F13258-7-18E-i16.png" /> resources. That is, a process can release at least one resource. Then, the <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/media%2Fa34%2Fa34c28c7-e406-4457-8f48-42fd00440f61%2F13258-7-18E-i17.png" />resources of same type can be shared by<img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/media%2F09e%2F09eb3409-3031-4754-a589-50562bc4a45a%2F13258-7-18E-i18.png" />processes.</p> <p>Here, the two conditions satisfy the deadlock free condition.</p> <p> <b>Therefore, the system that holds the two conditions</b> <b> is deadlock free.</b> </p></div>
