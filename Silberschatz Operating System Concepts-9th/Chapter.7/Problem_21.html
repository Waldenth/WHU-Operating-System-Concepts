<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Consider that a system is using two resources R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> and there are three processes P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub> and P<sub>3</sub>. The resources will be allocated to the processes based upon the requirements.</p> <p>The allocation status of the two resources R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> for the processes P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub> and P<sub>3</sub> are as follows:</p> <p>R<sub>1</sub>R<sub>2</sub>R<sub>1</sub>R<sub>2</sub> </p> <p>Consider the following:</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/182/182c3cdd-7d41-4e2c-8a66-403c654de446/13258-7-21E-i1.png" /> </p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>If the process P<sub>2</sub> were to make a request with (1, 0), then the system will allow it because the processes can complete in the sequence as follows:</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/22d/22db7dbb-9375-4bde-8d4f-382f38e6137f/13258-7-21E-i2.png" /> </p> <p>If the process P<sub>2</sub> were to make a request with (0, 1), then the system will allow it and the processes can complete in the sequence as follows:</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/0dc/0dcb87e6-34d0-49a8-b694-161df20f076e/13258-7-21E-i3.png" /> </p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>But, if the process P2 were to make a request with (1, 1), then the request will get rejected as no process can satisfy the request. Hence no process will be able to complete.</p></div>
