<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Pseudocode using semaphores to prevent deadlock:</b> </p> <p>The following is the pseudocode to prevent deadlock using deadlock.</p> <p>// Semaphore value to cross the bridge</p> <p>semaphore allowed_to_cross_bridge = 1;</p> <p>// Function definition</p> <p>void go_into_bridge()</p> <p>{</p> <p> // Suspend the process of crossing the birdge</p> <p> allowed_to_cross_bridge.wait();</p> <p>}</p> <p>// Function definition</p> <p>void way_out_of_bridge()</p> <p>{</p> <p> // Resume the suspended process</p> <p> allowed_to_cross_bridge.signal();</p> <p>}</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Explanation:</b> </p> <p>• The variable “allowed_to_cross_bridge” is represented by process waiting in queue.</p> <p>• During entry of the threads into the queue, a semaphore is coupled with each thread.</p> <p>• In the semaphore “go_into_bridge()” function, the process (village) which entered first into processor (bridge) will get executed (crossing the bridge) and followed by that the process next in the queue will get suspended using wait() operation.</p> <p>• In the semaphore “way_out_of_bridge()” function, the process which was suspended will be awakened and allowed to get executed (crossing the bridge). </p></div>
