<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>When there are 4 resources to be shared among 3 processes, and one process can occupy at most 2 resources, the system will be deadlock free. It has been explained through following points:</p> <p>• Two processes will hold 2 resources (1 each). </p> <p>• Third process will occupy 2 resources.</p> <p>• Third process can’t hold more than this, hence, it can release these resources after use.</p> <p>• When any of the 2 or both process will be released by third process, other process will be able to hold the free resource.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The situation can be better understood by the diagram given below:</p> <p>In figure 1 all the resources R1, R2, R3, and R4 have been allocated among 3 processes P1, P2 and P3.</p> <p>R1 has been allocated to P1.</p> <p>R2 has been allocated to P2.</p> <p>R3, R4 has been allocated to P3.</p> <p>P3 has occupied the maximum number of resources it can hold; hence, it is not waiting any other process to release resource. It will first release the resource, then only will occupy any other resource.</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/5fb/5fb035ba-98c1-4a0d-8f85-639aeee675c8/13258-7-17E-i1.png" alt="Picture 1" /> </p> <p>Figure 1</p> <p>Now when P3 has released R3 as shown in Figure 2 but still holding R4. R3 now can be allocated to any of the process.</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/872/8720dd95-098a-40ee-8724-2481dde485f2/13258-7-17E-i2.png" alt="Picture 2" /> </p> <p>Figure 2</p> <p>In figure 3, R3 has been allocated to P2. Hence, P2 has 2 resources R2 and R3.</p> <p>R1 has been allocated to P1.</p> <p>R4 has been allocated to P3.</p> <p>This diagrammatic explanation proves that it is not a deadlock situation.</p></div>
