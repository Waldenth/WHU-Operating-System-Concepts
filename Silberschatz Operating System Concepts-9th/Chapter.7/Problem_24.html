<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>An algorithm that examines the state of the system to determine whether a dead lock has occurred. An algorithm to recover from dead lock </p> <p> Detection algorithm should be invoked frequently. Resources allocated to deadlock processes will be idle until the deadlock can be broken. The number of processes involved in the dead lock cycle may grow. </p> <p> If detection algorithm is involved for every resource request, it will incur considerable overhead in computation time. The algorithms whenever invoked, CPU utilization drops below 40%. Hence system throughput cripples due to dead lock and this causes CPU utilizations to drop.</p></div>
