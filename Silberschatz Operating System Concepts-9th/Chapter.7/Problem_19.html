<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Use the following rule to perform the dining-philosophers problem without causing deadlock.</p> <p>When a philosopher makes a request for the chopstick, there are three situations:</p> <p>1. If there are no chopsticks, the request cannot be accepted and philosopher should wait until the availability of chopsticks.</p> <p>2. If there is one chopstick, the request cannot be satisfied until there are two chopsticks available.</p> <p>3. If there are two chopsticks available, the request can be accepted and philosopher can eat.</p> </div>
