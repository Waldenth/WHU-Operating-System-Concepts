<div class="answer"> <p>2481-7-16E SA: 8683</p> <p> SR: 6376</p> <p>There are four conditions that must be hold for a deadlock to occur.</p> <p>1. Mutual exclusion</p> <p>2. Hold and Wait</p> <p>3. No pre-emption</p> <p>4. Circular wait</p> <p>Circular-wait occurs only when there are a set of processes where, one process is waiting for the resources of another process. There must be atleast more than one process. With a single process, the circular wait condition does not hold. So it is not possible to have a deadlock involving only one process. </p></div>
