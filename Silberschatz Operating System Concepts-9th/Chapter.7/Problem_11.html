<div class="answer"> <p> </p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/87c/87c56fb7-f307-4534-bc1c-f4c56cbdf326/300-7-1e-i1.png" /></p> <p>a. The four necessary conditions for deadlock hold in this example for the following reasons: (i) Mutual Exclusion: Each of the vehicles present in the streets hold a non-sharable resource: the part of the road they occupy, which they cannot share with the other vehicles.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> (ii) Hold and Wait: Each of the vehicles hold the space resource they occupy and are waiting the space in front of them to be freed by other waiting vehicles. </p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>(iii) No Preemption: There is no possibility of preemption as none of the vehicles can give up their resource. In this situation preemption would have to take the form of a vehicle pulling into a parking lot, or a crane reaching down and lifting a vehicle off the road. </p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>(iv) Circular Wait: Circular wait is present because each vehicle is waiting for the space in front of it, and some vehicles occupy spaces where two vehicles wait on them. It is thus possible to trace a cycle of waiting cars. This is the weakest assertion in the set, though, and is clearly untrue out at the edges somewhere, since some car can clearly move someplace in the city. If you have ever experienced grid-lock, though you know that this is small comfort, and that a rule to avoid even "local" deadlock is extremely desirable.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-5</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> b. The simple rule that could be used to avoid traffic deadlocks in such a system is that intersections should always remain clear as lights change. In this way, the resource of space in the intersection is freed for use at periodic intervals (light changes).</p></div>
