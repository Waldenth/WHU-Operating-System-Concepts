<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Use the following rule to perform the dining-philosopher’s problem:</p> <p> </p> <p>When a philosopher makes a request for the chopstick, there are three situations:</p> <p>1. If there are no chopsticks, the request cannot be accepted and philosopher should wait until the availability of chopsticks.</p> <p>2. If there is one chopstick, the request cannot be satisfied until there are three chopsticks available.</p> <p>3. If there are two chopsticks, the request cannot be satisfied until there are three chopsticks available.</p> <p>4. If there are three chopsticks available, the request can be accepted and philosopher can eat.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Algorithm:</b> </p> <p>do</p> <p>{</p> <p> state[i]=Thinking;</p> <p> state[i] = hungry;</p> <p> if(chopstick[i]&& chopstick[i+1]&& chopstick[i+2])</p> <p> {</p> <p> pickup(chopstick[i],chopstick[i+1],chopstick[i+2mod 5]);</p> <p> Eat;</p> <p> pickdown(chopstick[i],chopstick[i+1],chopstick[i+2mod 5]);</p> <p>}</p> <p> else</p> <p> {</p> <p> wait(chopstick[i]);</p> <p> wait(chopstick[i+1]);</p> <p> wait(chopstick[(i+2)%5]);</p> <p> }</p> <p>}while(true) </p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Explanation :</b> </p> <p>• At the start, start do-while loop means each state will be verified.</p> <p>• At the first philosopher think, whether he is going to eat or not.</p> <p>• Check whether three chopsticks are available or not. If yes, then,pickup the chopstick and start eating.</p> <p>• Else wait for the chopsticks until Philosopher get all the three chopsticks.</p></div>
