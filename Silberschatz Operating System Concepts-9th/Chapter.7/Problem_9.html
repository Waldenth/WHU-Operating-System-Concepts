<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Deadlock detection</b> </p> <p> <b>Yes</b>, the deadlock detection can be implemented with the help of safety algorithm. The value of Max is representing a process which is requested maximum time and Max is a vector. The value if <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/31b/31bc49fa-bd7d-4548-93cf-75bd5fb0b03f/5644-7-8PE-i1.png" /> represent the resources for any process.</p> <p>In the calculation of safety algorithm, Need matrix is required. The Need matrix represents </p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/3a1/3a14bdc6-3b54-492d-ac60-5aed9d1800e7/5644-7-8PE-i2.png" /> </p> <p>Thus,</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/13a/13a70de8-4ffa-457c-8209-fc77d5322eae/5644-7-8PE-i3.png" /></p> <p>It is given that <i>Waiting</i> matrix is playing the same role as played by the <i>Need</i> matrix. So, it can be said that</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/a65/a65b8a87-52ec-4816-9ea1-85fd089f6ac4/5644-7-8PE-i4.png" /></p> <p>So, the deadlock detection can be implemented with the help of safety algorithm.</p></div>
