<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Detection of starving processes</b> </p> <p>No, the detection of the starve process is very difficult. A process is said to be starve process, if the process is never be executed. If a process is waiting for a long time for the requested resources, and the time is beyond the response time, than, the process is said to be starving. As the response time for any process is increased, the probability of starving is increased.</p> <p>The system can calculate the response time T to identify the problem of starvation. The resources can be allocated to a fix time interval. The system must have to fix the time T for any process P for execution. In any condition, the response time should not be delayed. By doing so, the system can deal with the problem of starving.</p></div>
