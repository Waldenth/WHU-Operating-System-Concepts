<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Deadlock is a condition where a process enters a never ending wait situation and hence the execution is halted for uncertain time duration. </p> <p>The major drawback of a process entering deadlock situation is, the resources the process was using at the time of deadlock arrival gets occupied until and unless the process wakes up from deadlock and finishes execution.</p> <p>Discussing the four necessary conditions of deadlock for this multi-threaded system; the reader-writer locks may contribute in the way discussed below:-</p> <p>• As there are several reader-writer locks, mutual exclusion is achieved successfully.</p> <p>• Each thread can hold one reader and writer, while keep waiting for another lock. Hence, hold-and-wait condition is also possible.</p> <p>• No reader-writer lock is available for taking away hence, preemption is not possible.</p> <p>• As multiple threads may wait for a reader-writer lock already acquired by some other thread in the process; process may go into a circular wait condition.</p> <p>If a multi-threaded application uses several reader-writer locks, the deadlock is more likely to arrive. Hence, the answer is YES a deadlock arrives in such situation.</p></div>
