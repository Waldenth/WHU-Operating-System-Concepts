<div class="answer"> <p>2481-7-12E SA: 8683</p> <p> SR: 6376</p> <p>a) </p> <p> <b>The arguments in favour of installing the deadlock-avoidance algorithm are: </b> </p> <p>1. It avoids deadlocks and the costs incurred by rerunning the terminated jobs. </p> <p>2. Reduces the wastage of resources by rerunning the jobs and also saves the time to run the aborted processes all over again. </p> <p>3. Resource utilization will be maximized and the machine idle-time is reduced.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>b) </p> <p> <b>The arguments against installing the deadlock avoidance algorithm are:</b> </p> <p>1. The average execution time per job will be increased by about 10 percent.</p> <p>2. The turnaround time would increase by about 20 percent. It introduces an overhead on the execution</p> <p>3. Deadlocks occur about twice per month and they cost little than the overhead added by installing the deadlock avoidance algorithm.</p></div>
