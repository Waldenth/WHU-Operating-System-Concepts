<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>a.</p> <p>Runtime overheads:</p> <p>• The algorithm in which it is less efficient the resource allocation graph scheme is said to be known as banker’s algorithm. It is one of the algorithms of deadlock-avoidance schemes.</p> <p>• The runtime overheads get increased by the deadlock avoidance such that it is only because of the current resource allocation cost.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>b.</p> <p>System throughput:</p> <p>• The request should be given by the process to use the resource such that after completion of using it, the resource must be released by the process.</p> <p>• For the prevention of deadlock, the deadlock avoidance scheme will allow a number of resources for concurrent use than schemes.</p> <p>• Finally, the system throughput will get increased by the deadlock avoidance scheme.</p></div>
