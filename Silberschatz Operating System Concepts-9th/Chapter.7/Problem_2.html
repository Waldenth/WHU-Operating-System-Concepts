<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Unsafe state:</b> </p> <p>Unsafe state is the situation that happens when the system contains less available resources but guarantees the completion of at least one job running on the system. But this may lead to a deadlock problem.</p> <p> <b>Deadlock:</b> </p> <p>In a computer system, a set of blocked processes each holding a resource and it is waiting to acquire the resource held by another process in the set is called a deadlock problem.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Example:</b> </p> <p>Consider that the system with 15 devices of same type and it is in an unsafe state.</p> <table border="1" style="border-collapse:collapse;"> <tr> <td> <p> <b>Job Number</b> </p> </td> <td> <p> <b>Device allocated</b> </p> </td> <td> <p> <b>Maximum required</b> </p> </td> <td> <p> <b>Remaining needs</b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>1</p> </td> <td> <p>5</p> </td> <td> <p>9</p> </td> <td> <p>4</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>2</p> </td> <td> <p>3</p> </td> <td> <p>7</p> </td> <td> <p>4</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>3</p> </td> <td> <p>4</p> </td> <td> <p>8</p> </td> <td> <p>4</p> </td> </tr> </table> <p>From the table,</p> <p>• The total number of devices allocated to the system is “12” and the total number of available devices is “15”.</p> <p>• The remaining devices which are available idle in the system is “3” <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/938/93838bf6-0394-47f6-b76e-150df0122725/13258-7-2PE-i1.png" />.</p> <p>• This proves that the system is in unsafe state. Because, the number of available devices is “3” and it is less than the number needed to satisfy the maximum requests “4”.</p> <p>• So, none of the job completes its execution and it suffers from the problem of deadlock.</p> <p>• But there is way to turn the system into a safe state,</p> <p>o The way is that to put the Job number “2” into the execution and it will face the execution time problem (for example: “division by zero” problem) and it will be terminated after some period of time by releasing 3 allocated devices.</p> <p>o Now, the system turns into safe state and it uses the released resources of “job2” to complete the execution of “job1” and “job3”.</p> <p>Therefore, the system in an unsafe sate is not necessarily deadlocked.</p></div>
