<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>In the banker’s algorithm, a process must not request a maximum number of instances of each resource type than the number of resources available in the system. This algorithm allocates the requested number of resources to the process only if the system remains in a safe state. Otherwise, it does not allocate the requested number of resources to the process to avoid deadlock. Then the process must wait until the resource available.</p> <p>• Available and Max are the data structures of the banker’s algorithm. </p> <p>• The Available is a vector contains <i>m</i> number of available resources of each resource type for <i>n</i> number of processes. </p> <p>• The Max indicates the maximum number of demands of each process for each resource types.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>a. Increase Available:</b> </p> <p>• If the Available length increased, then the number of available resources of each resource type will increase. </p> <p>• Then the instances of each resource type of a process will increases. The process can request for more instances of each available resource type. </p> <p>• This change can be made safely without deadlock.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>b</b>. <b>Decrease Available:</b></p> <p>• If the Available length decreased, then the number of available resources of each resource type will decrease. The resource will permanently remove from the system. </p> <p>• Then the instances of each resource type of a process will decrease. The process cannot request more instances of each available resource type. </p> <p>• If the process requests the number of instances of each resource type than the number of resources available in the system, then the deadlock will occur. </p> <p>• This change may lead to deadlock.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>c. Increase Max for one process:</b> </p> <p>• If the Max increased for one process, the number of demands of the process will increase. The process can demand for more resources than allowed. </p> <p>• If the process requests more instances of a resource than the available resources of each type, then the process must wait until another process release that resource. </p> <p>• If another process does not release the resource, then this condition leads to deadlock and system will be in the unsafe state.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-5</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>d. Decrease Max for one process:</b> </p> <p>• If the Max decreased for one process, the number of demands of the process will decrease. The process cannot demand more resources than allowed. </p> <p>• If the process requests fewer instances of a resource than the available resources of each type, then the process must not wait until another process release that resource. </p> <p>• This condition does not lead to deadlock and system will be in the safe state.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-6</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>e. Increase the number of processes:</b> </p> <p>• If the number of processes increases in the system, the resource allocation will be difficult. </p> <p>• If two or more processes requests for same instances of a resource at the same time, then some of the processes must wait until the resource is available. </p> <p>• This condition has the possibility of deadlock. The system will be in an unsafe state.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-7</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>f. Decrease the number of processes:</b> </p> <p>• If the number of processes decreases in the system, the resource allocation will be easier. </p> <p>• If the number of processes is less than the number of resources available in the system, then the system remains in a safe state.</p></div>
