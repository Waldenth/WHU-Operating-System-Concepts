<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>2481-7-7E SA: 8683</p> <p> SR: 6376</p> <p> <b>a)</b> </p> <p> <b>Deadlock will not occur</b>. By the given resource allocation policy, the necessary condition that cannot occur is the <b>No Preemption</b> condition. No preemption states that resources cannot be preempted, that is, a resource can be released only voluntarily by the process holding it, after that process has completed its task. But here, if blocked process has desired resource, then these resources are taken away from it and are given to the requesting process. So, it is not holding no preemption condition.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>b)</b> </p> <p> <b>Indefinite blocking can occur</b>. Because, processes might continuously come and take resources from the blocked process (as P2 gets resources from the blocked process P0); the blocked process might not get a chance to fulfill its needs.</p></div>
