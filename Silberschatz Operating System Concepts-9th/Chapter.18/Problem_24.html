<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The setuid feature of Linux allows the program to run with extra privileges than that of the user programs. In this there are two different UIDs of the process. One is that of the user that runs the program and other is that’s of the owner of the file. This feature makes it possible to execute special tasks leaving the security intact. </p> <p>There are two ways in which Linux implements the setuid feature. </p> <p>• This method was initially introduced to provide a possibility of switching among most effective UID, among the available ones. For this, the operating system allows and running program to pause the process and let down to a lower level. </p> <p>This lower level helps the program in getting unique effective UIDs repeatedly as long as the program finishes execution. Hence, this method minimized the total execution time and security risks for the program, which could have been messed up if any security loopholes occurred.</p> <p>• The second method was introduced to minimize the efforts of operating system in handling typical switches between several UIDs. In this method, Linux Operating System provides no access privileges to a user while execution process in going on. Hence, no processes can be suspended or killed during their execution time.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Difference between Linux and svr4 setuid:</b> </p> <p>Linux setuid feature is very much similar to the one of the svr4 as both of these implement UNIX. Nonetheless there are a few differences in the ways that they implement the feature in. </p> <p>1. Linux uses the file system ID of the process in the setuid process. This is usually equal to the effective user ID. This sets the file system ID of the process as well. If there is a nuance between the new and the old UID, the process will be forbidden from leaving the core dumps. </p> <p>2. The environment variables used in svr4 are slightly different from the ones that are used in Linux system. This makes the setuid syntax of Linux and working a bit different from the one that is used in svr4. </p></div>
