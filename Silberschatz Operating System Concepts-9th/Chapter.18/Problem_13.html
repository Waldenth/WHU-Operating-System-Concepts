<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> Linux provides the ability to create threads using clone() system call. When clone() is invoked, it is passed a set of flags that determine how much sharing is to take place between the parent and child tasks. Thus, if clone() is passed the flags CLONE_VM, CLONE_SIGHAND, and CLONE_FILES, the parent and child tasks will share the same file-system information, the same memory space, the same signal handlers, and the same set of open files. Using clone() in this fashion is equivalent to creating a thread in another system, since the parent task shares most of its resources with its child task. </p> <p> The lack of distinction between processes and threads is possible because Linux does not hold a process’s entire context within the main process data structure; rather it holds the context within independent subcontexts. Thus, a process’s file system context, file descriptor table, signal-handler table, and virtual memory context are held in separate data structures. The process data structure simply contains pointers to these other structures, so any number of processes can easily share a subcontext by pointing to the same subcontext as appropriate</p> <p> The arguments to the clone() system call tell it which subcontexts to copy, and which to share, when it creates a new process.</p></div>
