<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The organization of architecture-dependent and architecture-independent code in the Linux kernel is designed to satisfy two design goals: to as much code as possible common between architectures and to provide a clean way of defining architecture specific properties and code.</p> <p>There are different levels of architecture dependence in the kernel, and different techniques are appropriate in each case to comply with the design requirements. These levels include:</p> <p> <b>CPU word size and endianess </b>There are issues that affect the portability of all software written in C, but especially so for an operating system, where the size and alignment of data must be carefully arranged.</p> <p> <b>CPU process architecture</b> Linux relies on many forms of hardware support for its process and memory management. Different processors have their own mechanisms for changing between protection domains, rescheduling processes, managing virtual memory, and handling incoming interrupts.</p> <p>The Linux kernel source is organized so as to allow as much of the kernel as possible to be independent of the details of these-architecture specific features. To this end, the kernel keeps not one but two separate subdirectory hierarchies for each hardware architecture. One contains the code that is appropriate only for that architecture including such functionality as the system call interface and low-level interrupt management code.</p> <p>The second architecture specific directory tree contains C header files that are descriptive of the architecture. These header files contain type definitions and macros designed to hide the differences between architectures. They provide standard types for obtaining words of a given length, macro constants defining such things as the architecture word size or page size, and function macros to perform common tasks such as converting word to a given byte-order or doing standard manipulations to a page table entry.</p> <p>Given these two architecture specific subdirectory trees, a large portion of the Linux kernel can be made portable between architectures. When a 32-bit integer is required, the programmer must use the explicit _int32 type rather than assume than an int is a given size, for example. However, as long as the architecture specific header files are used, then most process and page-table manipulation can be performed using common code between the architectures. Code that definitely cannot be shared is kept safely detached from the main common kernel code.</p></div>
