<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> The stack is created at the top of user-mode virtual memory; it grows downward towards lower-numbered addresses. It includes copies of the arguments and environment variables given to the program in the exec() system call. The other regions are created hear the bottom and of virtual memory. The sections of binary file that contain program text or read–only data are mapped into memory as a write – protected region. Writable initialized data are mapped next; then any uninitialized data are mapped in as a private demand – zero – region.</p> <p> When a process tries to read a page in such (demand – zero memory) a region, it simply gives back a page of memory filled with zeros.</p></div>
