<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Dynamically Loadable Kernel Modules</b> </p> <p>Yes, these kernel modules have certain disadvantages as well. Two of these advantages are given below:</p> <p>1. <b>Memory Management:</b> Managing entire modules takes up a lot of memory owing to its <b>heavy size</b>. A kernel with multiple modules will take up much more memory space than a similar simple kernel in which the drivers are compiled within the image of the kernel.</p> <p>2. <b>Complexity:</b> These modules make the bootstrapping process of the kernel more complicated. If the driver that is required to access a disk is a module that itself takes some time to load; then, loading a set of modules from that disk is even more difficult. Due to this reason, extra efforts are required to manage the bootstrapping process of the kernel.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>It is better to keep a kernel split into modules when certain drivers are not always required. The kernel modules let the drivers that arenâ€™t required at present to be loaded and unloaded as per requests, which saves the physical memory because the drivers do not use the memory unnecessarily. For example, it is better to use modules when the kernel is to be used by multiple systems, like in case of distributed kernels, where the priority is to support a huge range of hardware in the easiest way possible.</p> <p>Whereas, it is better to compile a kernel into a single binary file and keep its size as small as possible when the drivers are being used constantly; especially, when they are being used for the boot itself. The drivers keep running with the help of the physical memory. An example of where to use kernels in the form of single binary files is, if a kernel is made just for one machine with known configuration, using modules will just make the system complex.</p></div>
