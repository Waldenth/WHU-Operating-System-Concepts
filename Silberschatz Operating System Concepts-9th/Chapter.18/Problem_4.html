<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Dynamic and Static Linkage of Libraries</b> </p> <p>A shared library is a file that is shared by many executable files. Dynamic linkage of library is also known as <b>DLL</b> and it provides a method to implement shared library concept. Shared libraries have file extension as <b>DLL</b>, <b>DRV</b> or <b>OCX</b>. A static library has functions, variables and routines which are copied to any application at compile time. </p> <p>The advantages of the static and dynamic libraries are given as follows:</p> <table border="1" style="border-collapse:collapse;"> <tr> <td> <p> <b>S. No.</b> </p> </td> <td> <p> <b>Dynamic Library</b> </p> </td> <td> <p> <b>Static Library</b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>1.</p> </td> <td> <p>The main advantage of <b>shared</b> or <b>dynamic</b> <b>library</b> is that is reduces the space in disk and memory used by the system to save the information.</p> </td> <td> <p>It requires linking of the files at compile time which decreases the startup time for program execution.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>2.</p> </td> <td> <p>When many running programs share the libraries, the starting time to run every new program is minimized because many functions required by the program are already present in the physical memory.</p> </td> <td> <p>In case if shared libraries get corrupted, some basic libraries are linked statically this gives the chance to correct the fault.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>3.</p> </td> <td> <p>The dynamic linkage of library also improves the <b>maintainability</b> compared to static linkage library.</p> </td> <td> <p>Static linkage provides <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>distribution</b> if the provider is not assured that user will have the right files installed in advance.</p> </td> </tr> </table> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Cases where static linkage of library is preferred over dynamic one are given as follows:</p> <p>• When a program is to be executed for the first time in the system it will link up the files at compile time rather than run time hence <b>reducing</b> the <b>time</b> to load the required data.</p> <p>• If shared libraries get corrupted then it will affect every linked program; in these cases static linkage of library is preferred.</p> <p>• Static linkage provides ease of distribution.</p></div>
