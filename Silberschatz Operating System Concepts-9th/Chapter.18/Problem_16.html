<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) is a scheduler used by Linux Operating System. The CFS introduced by Linux replaced the traditional concept of UNIX process scheduler. Both of them use different scheduling methods for aligning processes on processor. </p> <p> <b>Completely Fair Scheduler</b> </p> <p>This scheduler provides a choice of variable time slices, depending upon the process requirement. Similarly, priority is another core variable used by this scheduler. </p> <p>Hence, instead of allotting fixed time duration to each new process the scheduler designates a specific proportion of the processors time to each process undergoing execution. </p> <p>This depends on two different variables for scheduling. One is <b>Target Latency</b>; that is the length of time during which the process must run at least once. Other is <b>minimum granularity</b>; that is the minimum amount of time that is assigned to the process on the CPU.</p> <p> <b>Process Scheduler (UNIX)</b> </p> <p>Unlike CFS, process scheduler being used by UNIX provides a fixed time-slot to each-and-every process that enters the system. The process runs for dedicated time slot and gets replaced by any of the higher prioritized process in queue. </p> <p>Thus traditional approach takes only two things in account; time and priority. </p> <p>Understanding the concepts of these two it becomes easier to analyze that how CFS gives fairer results over the traditional process scheduler used by UNIX.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Fairness in Scheduling </b> </p> <p>Completely Fair Scheduler guarantees fairness and optimum efficiency when resources are utilized in the best possible way and corresponding costs for switching contexts are also minimized. </p> <p>For this, the scheduler always takes care of weight readjustment methods each time the systems enters a multi-threaded environment, so that no process stays idle for longer times span and switching processes also gets easier. </p> <p>Moreover, the time allotted to each process stays proportional to the number of processes that are being served by the CPU. This way, each process gets optimum possible time from CPU. </p></div>
