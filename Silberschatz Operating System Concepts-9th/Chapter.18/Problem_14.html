<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>UNIX system typically provides support for multiple Kernel – Level threads per process. But Linux Kernel offered no support for multithreading. A process may make use of and switch between multiple threads that are executed concurrently within the context of the process. Such threads are user level threads.</p> <p>Threads may be at kernel level. In this case they may be treated by the operating system in much the same way as a process and receive the hardware time sharing, which includes multiprocessor scheduling. User level thread libraries include POSIX pthreads, Mach c-threads and Solaris threads. Kernel level threads may receive special treatment, such as being scheduled to execute on a different processor or using hyper-threading within a processor. This achieves real parallelism that is not achieved with user level threads. Multiple user – level threads that constitute a single – user – level process are mapped into Linux Kernel – Level process that share the same group ID.</p></div>
