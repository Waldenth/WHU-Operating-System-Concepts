<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Journaling:</b> </p> <p>Journaling is a feature supported by file systems in which, encountered modifications in the file system are written on a journal. These modifications include alterations in the operating system, completion of transactions and other tasks. </p> <p>Journal entries related to the transactions might later be replayed through the file system. Journaling is typically supported by Linux ext3 file system. </p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Benefits of journaling</b> </p> <p>Below are listed some of the dazzling benefits of having journaling in file systems:-</p> <p>• Once committed, a transaction on the journaling supported file system can be recovered even after sudden system crash or failure. This helps in keeping the data consistent and in synchronization. </p> <p>• These file system are typically faster and more reliable as compared to other file systems. The reason is that applying the updates on the in-memory journal is easier and faster than the typical file systems without journaling facility. </p> <p>• Follows sequential Input/output rather than going for any random process. That means the cost of seeking and writing as in the random I/O system is completely taken care of and is gone because of the sequential access.</p> <p>• The changes can be applied asynchronously to the places where they are required in the data structures.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>As discussed, ext3 Linux File System goes with the synchronous sequential write operations rather than the random ones. This minimizes the cost for write operations. A counterpart is played when the file system replays the modifications done in asynchronous manner and that too in random access manner. </p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The resulting outcomes enhance the performance of metadata operations in the file system rather than being beneficial for the file data. This performance enhancement is the main reason behind ext3 supporting journal for metadata and excluding file data from this privileges.</p></div>
