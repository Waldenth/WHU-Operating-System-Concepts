<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <u> <b>fork() exec() :</b> </u> </p> <p>A new process is created by fork() system call; and a new program runs after a call to exec(). A new process may be created with fork() without a new program being run- the new sub process simply continues to execute exactly the same program that the first, parent process was running. Equally, running a new program does not require that a new process be created first. Any process may call exec() at any time. The currently running program is immediately terminated and new program starts executing in the context of the existing process.</p> <p> <u> <b>vfork():</b> </u> </p> <p>Some systems have a system call vfork(), which was originally designed as a lower-overhead version of fork(). Since fork() involved copying the entire address space of the process, and was therefore quite expensive, the vfork() function was introduced.</p> <p>The basic difference between the two is that when a new process is created with vfork(), the parent process is temporarily suspended, and the child process might borrow the parent's address space. This strange state of affairs continues until the child process either exits, or calls execve(), at which point the parent process continues. </p> <p>This means that the child process of a vfork() must be careful to avoid unexpectedly modifying variables of the parent process. In particular, the child process must not return from the function containing the vfork() call, and it must not call exit() </p></div>
