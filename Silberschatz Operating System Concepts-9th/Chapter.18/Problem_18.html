<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Soft real-time scheduling:</b> </p> <p>A scheduling technique where performance is not guaranteed and processes run out of data, when they are alarmed for optimization in preferences; such a scheduling technique is named as soft real-time scheduling. However, kernel does not give any guarantee about how quickly a real time process will be scheduled once it has come into the runnable state.</p> <p>Linux offers real time task processing facility via two scheduling algorithms; First Come First Serve and Round Robin scheduling.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Missing feature of real time programming</b> </p> <p>1. Due to the soft scheduling of tasks, the scheduling of the task cannot be guaranteed once it is in the runnable state. This might cause tasks to wait eternally in the worst case. This shortcoming might make the real time processing meaningless. </p> <p>2. The Linux system is not capable of providing response times of those worst-case or failure cases to any external events. Again, this can be cured by introducing hard real-time scheduling.</p> <p>3. In Linux kernel the tasks like system trap, external request for resource etc. may try to access the same data structure at the same time. This could lead to data corruption and many other acute consequences. Linux, however, provides mechanisms to stop that but they are costly and might not be available to all due to their cost.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Adding missing features to kernel</b> </p> <p>The features mentioned above can be added to kernel with some extra effort and implementation cost. </p> <p>1. Implementing a new scheduling policy would help overcome the problem of indefinite waiting of task. </p> <p>Newer versions of Linux provide scheduling classes that wrap scheduling policies and are implemented as module. These modules can be used as enhancements to the traditional system. </p> <p>2. A few changes in the data structure will make sure that no two requests for resources be served at the same time. </p> <p>Moreover, introduction to appropriate interrupts would make sure that a system error is generated in case of system failure. </p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Cost/Downsides of enhancements</b> </p> <p>The shortcomings of the system can be overcome. The implementation has been described in the previous section. Nonetheless, the implementation comes up with extra cost and sometimes might not be practical at all.</p> <p>1. Introducing the new scheduling algorithms and their implementation can be quite complex at times.</p> <p>2. Changes in data structure might be quite costly as huge changes might be required to facilitate the system with the mentioned features.</p> <p>3. Estimating the cost and risk of such implementation is quite a challenging task as the changes are related to kernel of the system itself. </p> <p>The implementations, moreover, could lead to reduced efficiency and less scalability of available resources. </p></div>
