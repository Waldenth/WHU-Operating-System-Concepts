<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>C makes UNIX highly portable as evidenced by many systems it runs on. It is also faster to write and debug code in a high-level language, allowing UNIX to be modified more quickly than assembly language based operating systems. Of course it runs less efficiently than if it had been written in assembly language, like most other operating systems. It is generally larger than assembly-language operating system too.</p> <p>The Libraries may also provide more complex version of basic system calls. C language’s buffered file – handling functions are all implemented in the system libraries, providing more advanced control of file I/O than the basic Kernel system calls. The Libraries also provide routines that do not correspond to system calls at all, such as sorting algorithms, mathematical functions and string manipulation routines. Use of some sophisticated features like implementation operating system is quite easily done from the C language without writing any assembly language. The main disadvantage is it is procedural, not object-oriented.</p></div>
