<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Reliable delivered message would be best, because transfers are sure to occur but open connections are not needed between the systems. Datagrams are the next best, because they are unreliable. Perhaps streams are another choice if open connection is desired. Sun NFS uses datagrams because reliable delivered messages are not implemented. A datagram is about the only choice for testing the availability of other systems, since they may or may not be able to receive a packet (disallowing the reliable delivered messages).</p></div>
