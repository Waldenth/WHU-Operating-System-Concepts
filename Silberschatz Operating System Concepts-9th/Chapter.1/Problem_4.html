<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>The application programs like mail programs and web browsers should not be added to the operating system because:- </b> </p> <p>• As per computer architecture, the computer system is categorised into four major components: application programs, operating system, hardware and user. The mail program and web browser belongs to application program, not to operating system.</p> <p>• Operating system is defined as the program which is running all the time on the computer system. But the mail programs and the web browsers do not run all the time on the system. Hence they cannot be regarded as operating systems.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>The arguments in favour of the mail programs and web browser to be included in operating system are: </b> </p> <p>• Operating system is defined as the program which acts as the interface between the hardware and the user. As the mail program and the web browser are the part of program between hardware and the computer user, controlling and allocating the resources, thus they are part of operating system. </p> <p>• Also, the operating systems generally include all those applications which are provided by vendors. As many vendors provide mail programs and web browsers along with operating systems, they are also included in operating systems.</p></div>
