<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>(a) </p> <p>• Direct memory access (DMA) command block is written to main memory which contains pointers to the source and destination of the transfer.</p> <p>• The central processing unit (CPU) writes the address of the command block to the DMA controller. It can initiate a DMA operation by writing values into special registers that can be independently accessed by the device. </p> <p>• The device initiates the corresponding operation once it receives a command from the CPU. When the device is finished with its operation, it interrupts the CPU to indicate the completion of the operation.</p> <p>• Here, all devices have special hardware controllers. Normally, an operating system (OS) has device drivers that communicate with the controllers. The device drivers have registers, counters and buffers to store arguments and results.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>(b)</p> <p>• After the completion of the task the dive controller interrupts the CPU.</p> <p>• The CPU initiates the transfer by supplying the interface with starting address and number of words needed to be transferred and then proceeds to execute other tasks when transfer is made.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>(c)</p> <p>• CPU is allowed to execute the other programs when device controller performs transfer of entire block of data from buffer to memory.</p> <p>• When the device controller sends the interrupt to the CPU, the current task of the CPU is suspended until the interrupt is finished.</p> <p>• It can access data in its primary and secondary cache memory because there is no interference with the user task.</p></div>
