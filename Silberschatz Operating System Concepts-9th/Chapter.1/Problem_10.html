<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>If the active portions of program and data are placed in a fast small memory the average memory access time can be reduced, thus reducing the total execution time of program. Such a fast small memory is referred as cache memory.</p> <p>Caches are useful when two or more components need to exchange data, and the components perform transfers at different speeds. Caches solve the transfer problem by providing a buffer of intermediate speed between the components. If the fast device finds the data it needs in the cache, it needs not wait for the slower device. The data in the cache must be kept consistent with the data in the components. If a component has a data value change, and the datum is also in the cache, the cache must also be updated. This is especially a problem on multiprocessor systems where more than one process may be accessing a datum. A component may be eliminated by an equal-sized cache, but only if: a) the cache and the component have equivalent state-saving capacity (that is, if the component retains its data when electricity is removed, the cache must retain data as well), and b) the cache is affordable, because faster storage tends to be more expensive.</p></div>
