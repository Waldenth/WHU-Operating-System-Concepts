<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>In order to know the advantages of Peer-to-Peer system in comparison to the client-server architecture user need to know the definition of peer-to-peer system and client-server model. </p> <p> <b>Peer to Peer system</b>: In peer to peer system, client and server are not different to each other. All the nodes belonging to the system are considered as the peers. Client can act as server if it is providing services and the server can act as the client if it is requesting for the service.</p> <p> <b>Client server system</b>: In client server system, client always requests for the service and the server always responds to the services made by the clients</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Advantages of Peer to Peer systems over client server system:</b> </p> <p>• Peer to peer system is easy to install and hence the configuration of this type of network is easy. </p> <p>• Due to constant migration of peers, security is maintained which is not so in case of client server system as he location of server is known on the internet.</p> <p>• Peer to peer systems facilitate higher bandwidth compared to client server systems because all the bandwidth of peers can be collectively used rather than a server’s single bandwidth.</p> <p>• All contents and the resources are shared by all the nodes unlike client server system in which all the contents and resources are shared by the server only. This minimizes burden on a single server. </p> <p>• Central dependency which is the dependency on the server is eliminated by the peer to peer system which makes it more reliable than the client server system. If one node fails then another node can act as server in peer to peer network but in client server network, if server goes down then whole system will be affected.</p> <p>• Peer to peer systems can work even on basic operating system while specialized operating systems are needed by the client server system.</p></div>
