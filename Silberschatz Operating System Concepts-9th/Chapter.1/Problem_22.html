<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Caching system:</b> </p> <p>• Cache is the temporary memory which is used for fast access. When a particular piece of information is needed, it is firstly searched into the cache. It is used directly from the cache if it is present here otherwise this information is used form the memory by putting a copy of the information into the cache.</p> <p>• The design of cache into different levels with local caches near each processing core and the one shared by all cores is due to access speed and cost. The access will be faster if the cache is near the processing core. But the fast caches are costly. </p> <p>• Hence smaller and faster cache is placed local to each core and the shared cache which is larger but slower is shared among different processing cores. </p></div>
