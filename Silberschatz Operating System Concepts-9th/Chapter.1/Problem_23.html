<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP):</b> </p> <p>In <b>Symmetric Multiprocessing (</b>SMP) system, each processor performs all tasks within the operating system. All the processors in SMP are peers; the relationship of master-slave does not exist between processors. Each processor has its own set of registers, as well as a private or local cache. These processors share physical memory. In SMP, N-processors can run N-processes simultaneously. The I/O should be controlled properly so that the data reaches appropriate processor. </p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>

<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Let us consider an example how data residing in memory could in fact have two different values in each of the local caches. Consider a process ‘a’ gets the data from the main (physical) memory. The process is running in the CPU core0. It performs certain operation on the data and it is changed. Before the data is returned to the memory, another process ‘b’ gets the same data from the main memory. Again the process ‘b’ which is running in the CPU core1 performs some operations on the data. Initially the data taken from the physical memory is same. But the data after reading from the memory is stored in the CPU’s own cache and the operations are performed. </p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The data in the local cache of CPU core0 is obtained after the operations of process ‘a’ are performed. Similarly, the data in the local cache of CPU core1 is obtained after the operations of process ‘b’ are performed. So, the data will be different. From this we can say that the data residing in the memory could in fact have two different values in each of the local caches. </p></div>
