<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/7b5/7b5530d2-7694-4678-8404-f274733b30c6/300-1-1e-i1.png" />300-1-1E</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>(a) </p> <p> In a multiprogramming and time-sharing environment, several users share the system simultaneously. This situation results in two problems. Stealing or copying a user's files; writing over another program's (belonging to another user or to the OS) area in memory; using system resources (CPU, disk space) without proper accounting; causing the printer to mix output by sending data while some other user's file is printing. </p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>(b) </p> <p> Probably not, since any protection scheme devised by a human can also be broken -- and the more complex the scheme is, the more difficult it is to be confident of its correct implementation. </p> <p>.</p> <p> </p></div>
