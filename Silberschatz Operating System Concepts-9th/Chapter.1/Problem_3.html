<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>2481-1-17E SA: 8683</p> <p> SR: 4578</p> <p>________________________________________________________________________</p> <p> A <b>real-time system</b> has well-defined, fixed time constraints. Processing must be done within the defined constraints, or the system will fail. For example, it would not do for a robot arm to be instructed to halt after it had smashed into the car it was building. A real-time system functions correctly only if it returns the correct result within its time constraints. So, <b>the main difficulty</b> is keeping the operating system within the fixed time constraints of a real-time system. Therefore when writing an operating system for a real- time system, the writer must be sure that his scheduling schemes donâ€™t allow response time to exceed the time constraint.</p></div>
