<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Purpose of Interrupts:</b> </p> <p> Interrupts are generated by the hardware devices. In the case of happening of interrupts, there is no role of software. Interrupts are asynchronous or passive means if there is any instruction running then interrupt has to wait to happen.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Difference between Trap and Interrupt:</b> </p> <table border="1" style="border-collapse:collapse;"> <tr> <td> <p> <b>Interrupt</b> </p> </td> <td> <p> <b>Trap</b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>It is a hardware signal.</p> </td> <td> <p>It is a software interrupt.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>It is caused by external events like graphic card, I/O port etc.</p> </td> <td> <p>It is caused by software programs like divided by zero.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>It will not repeat as it is caused by an external event.</p> </td> <td> <p>It can be repeat as it is software program. It can be repeated according to the calling of that instruction.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>They can be handled by jump statements.</p> </td> <td> <p>They cannot be handled by jump statements.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Interrupts are asynchronous events as they are related to external events.</p> </td> <td> <p>Traps are caused by current program instructions; thus they are called as synchronous events.</p> </td> </tr> </table> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Yes, traps can be generated by the user program intentionally.</p> <p> <b>Purpose of calling Traps:</b> </p> <p> Traps can be used to call intentionally to call Operating system routines or to catch arithmetic errors like divide by zero.</p></div>
