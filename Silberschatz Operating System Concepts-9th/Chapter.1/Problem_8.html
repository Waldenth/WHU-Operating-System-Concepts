<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>2481-1-20E SA: 8683</p> <p> SR: 4578</p> <p>________________________________________________________________________</p> <p>Most of the CPUs provides two modes of operation.</p> <p> 1. Kernel mode</p> <p> 2. User mode</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Some CPUs have supported <b>multiple modes</b> of operation by providing different distinctions in kernel mode and user mode separately, rather than distinguishing between just kernel and user mode.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Two possible uses of these multiple modes are:</b> </p> <p>1. One possibility would be to provide different distinctions within kernel code. For example, a speci◊c mode could allow USB device drivers to run. This would mean that USB devices could be serviced without having to switch to kernel mode, there by essentially allowing USB device drivers to run in a quasi-user/kernel mode.</p> <p>2. Second possibility would be to provide different distinctions within user mode. Multiple user modes could be used to provide a ◊ner-grained security policy. Perhaps users belonging to the same group could execute each other’s code. The machine would go into a speci◊ed mode when one of these users was running code. When the machine was in this mode, a member of the group could run code belonging to anyone else in the group.</p></div>
