<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Differences between client-server and peer-to-peer models of distributed systems are as follows:</p> <table border="1" style="border-collapse:collapse;"> <tr> <td> <p> <b>Client-server model</b> </p> </td> <td> <p> <b>Peer-to-peer model</b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>In this model, systems are categorized as server systems and client systems. </p> </td> <td> <p>In this model, all nodes are considered as peers. </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Client systems request for services from server systems.
