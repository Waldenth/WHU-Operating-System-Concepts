<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Cluster Systems gather together multiple CPUs to accomplish computational work.</p> <p>cluster system differs from parallel system. The cluster computer share storage and are closely linked via LAN networking.</p> <p> Clustering provides high-availability service will continue to be provided even if one or more system in the cluster fail. Clustering can be structured symmetrically or asymmetrically. In asymmetric clustering, one machine is in hot-standby mode, while the other is running the applications. The host – standby host machine does nothing but monitor the active server. If that server fails, the hot – standby host becomes the active server.</p> <p> In symmetric mode, two or more hosts are running applications, and they are monitoring each other. This mode is more efficient, as it uses all the available hardware. It requires more than one application be available to run.</p></div>
