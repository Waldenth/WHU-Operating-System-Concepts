<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Time sharing system or multitasking is a logical extension of multiprogramming. In time-sharing, CPU executes multiple jobs by switching one after another process to execute. When switches occur frequently, then the user can interact with each program while it is running. But, multitasking and multiprogramming is not possible on single user work station.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>The time sharing is best under following circumstances:</b> </p> <p>• In a work station, if there are few users to complete the large task, and hardware is fast, then at the point of time timesharing system is useful to complete the task with in the stipulated time.</p> <p>• The other way to use the time sharing is when lots of users need so many resources at the same time.</p> <p> <b>The Personal Computer is best under following circumstances:</b> </p> <p>• Personal computer is best, when the job is small enough to be executed with in short amount of time. </p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>The time-sharing system is better than PC under following circumstances:</b> </p> <p>• A time-sharing operating system uses CPU scheduling and multiprogramming to provide each user with a small portion of a time-shared computer.</p> <p>• If other users need to access the same system, then a time-sharing system would work better than a PC or a single-user workstation.</p> <p>• If there is only a single and exclusive user, then a PC or single-user workstation would be better to use the less amount of resources.</p> <p>• To work remotely on the system, then time sharing system is useful then PC.</p> <p>• Time sharing system is better than PC when compared to cost, and ease of use.</p></div>
