<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>(a)Single-processor system</p> <p> In an environment where only one process executes at a time, arrangement of cache makes no difficulties. Where as in multi tasking environment it should be dealt properly.</p> <p>(b)Multiprocessor system</p> <p> Since the CPU switches back and forth among various process, cache should be taken special care. The situation becomes more complicated in a multiprocessing environment where in addition to maintaining internal registers, each of CPUs also contains a local cache. Hence may exist simultaneously in several caches. Since CPU (various) can execute concurrently, we must make sure that an update to the value ‘a’ in one cache is immediately reflected in all other cache where ‘a’ resides. This situation is called Cache Coherency. And is usually hardware problem.</p> <p>(c) In distributed environment situation becomes even more complex. Several copies of same file can be kept on different systems that are distributed in space. </p> <p> Since the various replicas may be accessed and updated concurrently, some distributed system ensures that when a replica is updated in one place, all another replicas are brought up to date as soon as possible.</p></div>
