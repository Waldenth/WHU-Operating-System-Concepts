<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Computing Current Time</b> </p> <p>Timers can take the help of a program that uses the following steps to calculate the current time with the help of timer interrupts:</p> <p>1. Sets the timer for some time later than the current time and goes to sleep.</p> <p>2. An interrupt wakes up the program; that is when it updates its local state, which it uses to keep a record of the number of interrupts it has received by far.</p> <p>3. Then it repeats this process of establishing timer interrupts and updating its local state when these timer interrupts are raised.</p></div>
