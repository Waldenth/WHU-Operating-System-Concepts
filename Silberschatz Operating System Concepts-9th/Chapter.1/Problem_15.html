<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>• <b>Symmetric processing</b> treats all processors as equals; I/O can be processed on any of them. <b>Asymmetric processing</b> designates one CPU as the master, which is the only one capable of performing I/O; the master distributes computational work among the other CPUs. </p> <p>• <b>Advantages:</b> Multiprocessor systems can save money, by sharing power supplies, housings, and peripherals. Can execute programs more quickly and can have increased reliability. </p> <p>• <b>Disadvantages:</b> Multiprocessor systems are more complex in both hardware and software. Additional CPU cycles are required to manage the cooperation, so per-CPU efficiency goes down. </p> <p>In detail…</p> <p>The three advantages of multiprocessor systems are:-</p> <p>i. Increased throughput: - By increasing the member of processor, we hope to get more work done in less time.</p> <p>ii. Economy of scale: - Multiprocessor system can cost less than equivalent multiple slave-relationships exists between processors. Each processor concurrently runs a copy of the operating system.</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/ca2/ca211271-5e54-4c28-9ab0-203989740773/300-1-5e-i1.png" />SMP Architecture</p> <p>Example of SMP is Solaris, a commercial version of Unix designed by Sun Micro system.</p> <p>The difference between symmetric and asymmetric multi processing may result from either hardware or software. Single processor system because they can share peripherals, mass storage, and power supplies.</p> <p>iii. Increased reliability: if functions can be distributed properly among several processors, then the failure of one processor will not halt the system, only slows it down.</p> <p>The main disadvantage of multi process or system is that if the operation is continued in the presence of failures, requires a mechanism to allow the failure to be detected, diagnosed, and if possible, corrected. The tandem system uses both hardware and software duplication to insure continued operation despite faults. The system consists of two identical processor, each with its own local memory. The processors are connected is the primary and the other is the backup. Two copies are kept of each process. One on the primary processor and the other on the primary processor</p> <p>And the other on the back up. At fixed check points in the execution of the system the state information of each job:-</p> <p>Including a copy of the memory image is copied from the primary machine to the backup. If a failure is detected, the backup copy is activated and is started from the most recent checkpoint. This solution is expensive, since it involves considerably hardware duplication. </p> <p> Symmetric Multi procession (SMP) is one in which each processor runs a copy of the operating system and these copies communicate with one another as needed.</p> <p> Asymmetric multi processing is one in which each processor is assigned a specific task. A master processor controls the system, the other processor either look to the master for instruction or have pre-defined tasks. This scheme defines a master-slave relationship. The master processor schedules to allocates work to the slave processors. SMP (symmetric multi processor) means that all processors are peers; no master </p> <p> </p></div>
