<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>There is a distinction in execution between kernel mode and user mode of the operating system. This distinction in execution provides a rudimentary form of protection system.</p> <p> <b>Kernel mode:</b> </p> <p>• It is mandatory that certain instructions must be executed only when the operating system in kernel mode.</p> <p>• Access to hardware devices can be done only when the program is executing in kernel mode.</p> <p>• Interrupts can be controlled only when the CPU is executing in kernel mode.</p> <p>• The privileged instructions can be executed only when the CPU is in kernel mode.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>User mode:</b> </p> <p>• When the CPU is executing in user mode, its capacity is limited. </p> <p>• Executing privileged instructions in user mode will cause a trap to the operating system. </p> <p>Thus, dual mode of operation provides a rudimentary form of protection system.</p></div>
