<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> </p> <p>Designing an operating system without the use of processor privilege levels is possible.</p> <p>MS-DOS or CP/M (single tasking operating systems) or Microsoft's Windows 3.1 (a multitasking operating system), none of which use this capability are some of the examples of such design.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>• However, security for those designs will become difficult to achieve. All code must be verified by the operating system prior to being run or interpreted with extensive run-time checks when the design requires security. The vaporware operating system JOS is an example of that design.</p> <p>• The user ID and group ID are sufficient for the users to use the system normally. Sometimes escalate privileges are needed to gain extra permission for some activities.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>• Privileged mode is not provided by few systems, but the data will be secure. This is possible in which the security is provided by operating system by maintaining a list of user names and associated user identifiers (UIDs).</p> <p>• The ID’s for each and every user will be unique. The authentication stage determines the appropriate user Id for the user when the user logged in to the system. User ID’s are associated with all the name of the processes and threads. The ID is translated back to username using the user name list if an ID needs to be user readable.</p></div>
