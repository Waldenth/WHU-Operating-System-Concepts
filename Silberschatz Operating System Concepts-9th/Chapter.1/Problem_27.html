<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>In the mobile operating system there is a kernel and also a middleware. The middleware consist of set of software framework which helps in providing additional services to the application developers. </p> <p> <b>Challenges of designing operating system for mobile devices in comparison to Computer:</b> </p> <p>• In mobile operating system, besides designing a core kernel, a middleware also has to be designed for supporting set of software frameworks which helps in providing additional services to the application developers. But, in the computer middleware is not required. </p> <p>• The mobile operating system has to balance its performance with the available battery life. Battery life in the mobile operating system is limited. But, in computer PC they need not to balance its performance with the available battery. </p> <p>• The mobile operating system should have good support for peripheral such as HDMI or GPS. There are no such facilities of GPS and HDMI in mobile operating system. </p> <p>• Owing to smaller size of mobile devices, limited resources, like memory and processors, are available. As a result, mobile operating system must manage these resources carefully. In computer PC there is no issues in the management of the resources. </p> <p>• The security issue of mobile operating system must also be taken care of as mobile devices are related with privacy of people.</p></div>
