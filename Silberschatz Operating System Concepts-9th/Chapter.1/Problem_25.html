<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Memory protection:</b> </p> <p>A program can modify the memory allocated to another program if it requires more memory. This process can cause problems in memory management; this can be avoided by enforcing memory protection mechanism.</p> <p>• Memory for a program should be allocated as a chunk which is of fixed size.</p> <p>• If the program requires more memory for execution, allocate extra chunk of free memory.</p> <p>• The system should keep track of fixed memory chunks allocated to a program, and it should not allow a program to access memory outside of its allocation.</p> <p>• Simpler method is to keep track of all chunks of memory allocated to programs and during access to the memory chunks its bounds should be checked.</p></div>
