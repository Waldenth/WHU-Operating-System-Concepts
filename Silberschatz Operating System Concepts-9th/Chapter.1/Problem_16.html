<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Clustered Systems</b> </p> <p> It is made up of together of multiple CPUs to accomplish computational work. Clustered systems differ from multiprocessor systems, however, in that they are composed of two or more individual systems compiled together. It shares storage and are closely linked via LAN networking. </p> <p>It provides high- availability service. i.e. service will continue to be provided even if one or more systems in the cluster fails. High- availability is generally obtained by adding a level of redundancy in the system. A layer of cluster software runs on the cluster nodes. Each node can monitor one or more of the others (over LAN). If the monitored machine fails, the monitoring machine can take ownership of its storage and restart the application that were running on failed machine.</p></div>
