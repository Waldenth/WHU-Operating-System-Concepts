<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>In peer to peer system, client and server are not different to each other. All the nodes belonging to the system are considered as the peers. Client can act as server if it is providing services and the server can act as the client if it is requesting for the service.</p> <p>Following are some distributed application of peer to peer system:</p> <p>• <b>File sharing: </b>Peer to peer substrate is used by the file sharing application for discovering that which peer has made the request. </p> <p>As soon as the requesting peers are found, a connection between the supplier and the requester is established for providing and storing the files to the requesting nodes. Grokster, Gnutella, kazaa and Overnet are some examples of file sharing application.</p> <p>• <b>File and storage system</b>: Functions which are similar to centralized file server are provided by the distributed file system for file and storage system. Replication, data integration and consistency, caching, directory structure and access control are some functions which are provided by the distributed file system. </p> <p>Structured peer to peer substrate is used by the distributed file system for providing efficiency and guarantee of locating files. OceanStore and cooperative file system are examples of file and storage system Building the file system by peer to peer substrate will achieve:-</p> <p>• Cost effectiveness</p> <p>• High availability</p> <p>• Huge storage capacity</p> <p>• <b>Distributed cycle sharing</b>: In distributed cycle sharing applications, CPU processing power is the resource of interest. Pieces of large computational problems are processed independently by the peers in which enormous amount of CPU processing is needed. The large computational problem has to be divided into smaller pieces for facilitating distributed processing. </p> <p>• <b>Intellectual property law and illegal sharing: </b>Intermediate server is not used in peer to peer networking for the data transfer purpose. In peer to peer network, the file sharing is legal until the developer has no authority to prevent sharing of copyright material.</p></div>
