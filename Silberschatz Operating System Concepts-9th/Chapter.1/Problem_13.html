<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Resource Management</b> </p> <p>Resource utilization is a major issue that occurs in different forms in different types of operating systems. It is important to manage resources to perform tasks efficiently and in a fair manner.</p> <p>a) The resources that must be managed in <b>Mainframe or Minicomputer Systems</b> are listed below:</p> <p>1. <b>Memory</b> <b>Resources</b>: Main memory (RAM) is an important part of the mainframe systems that must be carefully managed, as it is shared amongst a large number of users.</p> <p>2. <b>CPU</b> <b>Resources</b>: Again, due to being shared amongst a lot of users it is important to manage CPU resources in mainframes and minicomputer systems.</p> <p>3. <b>Storage</b>: Storage is an important resource that requires to be managed due to being shared amongst multiple users.</p> <p>4. <b>Network</b> <b>Bandwidth</b>: Sharing of data is a major activity in systems shared by multiple users. It is important to manage network bandwidth in such systems.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>b) The resources that must be managed in <b>Workstations Connected to Servers</b> are mentioned below:</p> <p>1. <b>Memory</b> <b>Resources</b>: When workstations are connected to servers, multiple applications run on multiple workstations on a single server. This is an important factor due to which memory management is required in workstations connected to servers.</p> <p>2. <b>CPU</b> <b>Resources</b>: Multiple workstations make requests to access resources to accomplish the tasks assigned to them. To ensure the fair and efficient completion of tasks, it is important to manage CPU resources in workstations connected to servers.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>c) The resources that need to be managed in <b>Handheld</b> <b>Computers</b> are listed below:</p> <p>1. <b>Power</b> <b>Consumption</b>: Handheld computers use compact, portable and small batteries as a source of power. It is important to manage power consumption in such devices to be able to make their use efficient and easy.</p> <p>2. <b>Memory</b> <b>Resources:</b> Due to being small in size, the memory devices used in such computers are also small, thus deteriorating its storage capacity. This makes memory resource management an important requirement in handheld devices.</p></div>
