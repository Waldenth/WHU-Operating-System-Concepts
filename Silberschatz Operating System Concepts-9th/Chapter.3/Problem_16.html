<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>When local procedure fails under extreme circumstances, RPC can fail, or be duplicated and executed more than once, as a result of network errors. This is said to be semantics of call.</p> <p>• Let us consider “at most once” semantic in which this can be made possible by attaching a time stamp to each message.</p> <p>• The server must keep a history of all the time stamp of messages it has already processed or ensure that repeated message it has already processed or ensure that repeated messages are detected.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>• Incoming message with time stamp will be ignored. The client will send a message more than one times and it will be executed only once.</p> <p>• “Exactly once” will remove the risk that the server will never receive the request. In order to complete this, the server must implement the “at most once” protocol as well as the acknowledgement should be provided to client that RPC was received and executed.</p> <p>• These “ACK” message are common throughout networking. The client must resend each RPC call periodically until it receives the “ACK” for that call.</p> <p>• The concern for communication between a server and a client is of the form of binding takes place during link, load or the execution time, in which the name of the procedure call will be replaced by memory address of the procedure call. </p> <p>Similar binding of the client and server port is required for the RPC scheme. RPC scheme may be useful.</p></div>
