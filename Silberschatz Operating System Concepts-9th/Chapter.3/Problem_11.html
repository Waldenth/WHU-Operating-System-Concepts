<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Role of </b> <b>init </b> <b>process with respect to the process termination:</b> </p> <p>• The initial thing an init process does on initialization is reading the status of etc/init tab file. This file is the initialization file for this process and commands the system about several to-do instructions on a program. </p> <p>• Besides this, init process has role in process termination too. If the parent process terminates before calling the wait(), it makes the child as orphans. This case is handled in UNIX and LINUX systems by assigning init process.</p> <p>• This process periodically calls wait(), helping in collection of exit status of any orphaned child process and releasing its processID and process-table entries.</p> <p>• It also commands terminated processes to restart with the help of “respawn” action.</p></div>
