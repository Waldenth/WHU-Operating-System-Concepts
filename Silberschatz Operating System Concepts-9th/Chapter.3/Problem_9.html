<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The process of context switching between the processes is accomplished by the kernel.</p> <p>This process is performed as follows:</p> <p>1. In reply to the clock interrupt, Operating System stores the value of the Program Counter and the user Stack Pointer of the presently implementing process, and handovers charge to the kernel clock interrupt handler, </p> <p>2. The clock interrupt handler hold back the remaining registers, along with other machine status, such as the status of the floating point registers in the Process Control Block of the process. </p> <p>3. The Operating System call upon the scheduler to decide the next process that has to be implemented.</p> <p>4. The Operating System takes the status of the next process from its Process Control Block and fix up the registers. This restore task takes the processor back to the state in which the process was earlier interrupted, implementing in user code with user mode privileges.</p></div>
