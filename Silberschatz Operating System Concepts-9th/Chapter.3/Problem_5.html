<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Processes</b> </p> <p>When a process uses the <i>fork()</i> to create a new process, allthe new processes corresponding to the parent process are created and loaded into a separate memory location for the child process by the operating system. The parent process and the newly created child process only share the <b>shared memory segments</b>.</p> <p>Therefore, the correct answer is <b>C) Shared memory segments </b>.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Stacks and heaps are not shared by these processes. Instead, new copies of the stack and the heap are made for the newly created process, when a process tries to write into these. Therefore, option “<b>A</b>” and “<b>B</b>” are <b>incorrect</b>.</p></div>
