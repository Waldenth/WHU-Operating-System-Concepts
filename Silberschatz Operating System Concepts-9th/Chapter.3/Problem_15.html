<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>In the following situations named pipes are more suitable than ordinary pipes</b>.</p> <p>• Named pipes are more suitable than ordinary pipes when the medium is bidirectional, and there is no parent child relationship between processes. </p> <p>• Named pipes are more suitable than ordinary pipes in situations where we want to communicate over a network rather than communicating with the processes resides on the same machine. </p> <p>• Named pipes can be used to listen to requests from other processes (similar to TCP/ IP ports). If the calling processes are aware of the name, they can send requests to this. Unnamed pipes cannot be used for this purpose.</p> </div>
