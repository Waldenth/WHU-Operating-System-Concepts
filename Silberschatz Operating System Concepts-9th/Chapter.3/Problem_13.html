<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Consider the code provided in figure 3.33 of chapter 3. The explanation of the code is as follow:</p> <p>• In main function, the first statement declare a variable pid of pid_t type to store the return value of fork() function.</p> <p>• After that fork() function is called and store its return value in pid variable. The return value of fork() are as follow:</p> <p>• If call returns in parent process, return value will be process id of child process. </p> <p>• If returns in child process then return value will be ‘0’.</p> <p>• If call fails and no new process created then return value will be -1.</p> <p>• When value of variable pid becomes 0 then the condition statement else if (pid == 0)is true. Now all the statement inside this conditional statement get executes.</p> <p>• After this execlp(“/bin/ls”,”ls”,NULL) function get executes. The argument of this function contains the list of other executable files, if file exist then that file execute otherwise returns a value -1 which represent the error.</p> <p>• If name of the file provided in the execlp() function does not exist then the line Printf(“LINE J”) get executes.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The above explanation gives a clear view that an error in executing execlp() function would result in achieving the print command for the program. The reasons for this may be absence of “bin/ls” or it might have been corrupted or no permission for its access. </p></div>
