<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>There are 8 processes created, because whenever a fork<i>()</i> function called, it creates processes as child nodes of a growing binary tree. If fork() function is called two times, it will create <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/f0f/f0ff3fcf-6504-416b-a126-68f43e71b441/13258-3-2PE-i1.png" />processes. All these 4 processes will be the child node of binary tree. </p> <p>If fork() function is called unconditionally l times, we will have 2<sup>l</sup> processes.</p> <p>In this program fork() function is being called 3 times without any condition. So this program will generate total <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/2bf/2bfa4b20-d9ce-42b9-a8d2-f176251bf412/13258-3-2PE-i2.png" />processes. There will be one parent process and seven child processes.</p></div>
