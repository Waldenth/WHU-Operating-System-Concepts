<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The fork()is a system call that create a new process. A system call split a process into two processes. These two processes are: </p> <p>• Parent Process </p> <p>• Child Process</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>To determine the number of processes created, take the code piece as below:</p> <p>for(i=0; i<4; i++)</p> <p> fork();</p> <p>This piece of code is equivalent to four consequent fork() calls. Hence the code can be written as:-</p> <p>fork();</p> <p>fork();</p> <p>fork();</p> <p>fork();</p> <p>The diagram in figure 1 illustrates how the child processes are created with calls to fork in the program:-</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/ad8/ad828609-5dfb-457b-8102-dae34972c4a3/13258-3-12E-i1.png" alt="C:\Users\kaifi\Desktop\CDR Tif\4.png" /> </p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Explanation:</b> </p> <p>• The parent process is taken as “p0”. As there are 4 fork calls in the main program, 4 child processes, named p1, p2, p3 and p4 are created initially with call to each fork (). These child processes execute in similar and in parallel with parent process. </p> <p>• The newly created child process p1 now encounters the bottom 3 of the four fork calls and create 3 child processes named p5, p6 and p7 with call to second, third and fourth fork () respectively. </p> <p>• The child process p5 now encounters bottom two fork () calls and creates two new child processes called p11 and p12.</p> <p>• The process p11 will encounter just one fork () call, that is, the bottom most and create a child p15.</p> <p>• As p6 is created with call to third fork (), it will also encounter just one fork () call, that is, the bottom most and create a child p13. </p> <p>• The process p12, created with last fork () call will not meet any new fork () and thus will not create any new child process. Similar will be the case for processes p15, p13 and p7.</p> <p>• Similarly, the process p2, being created with call to second fork (), encounters bottom two fork () calls and creates two new child processes called p8 and p9.</p> <p>• As p8 is created with call to third fork (), it will encounter just one fork () call, that is, the bottom most and create a child p14. Similarly, p3 will create p10.</p> <p>• The processes p14 and p9, each created with last fork () call will not meet any new fork () and thus will not create any new child process. Similar will be the case for p4 and p10.</p> <p>The whole procedure is depicted with the help of Figure 1.</p> <p>Thus 15 new child processes will be created. Including the initial parent process, there are 16 processes created by the program.</p> <p>Hence, in all <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/87f/87fa7673-127d-453e-9477-6e64b1333cd4/13258-3-12E-i2.png" />processes are created.</p></div>
