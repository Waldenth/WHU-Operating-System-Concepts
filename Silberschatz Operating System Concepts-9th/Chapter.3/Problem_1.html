<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The fork()is a system call that create a new process. A system call split a process into two processes. These two processes are: </p> <p>• Parent Process </p> <p>• Child Process</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The memory pages which are used by original process are then duplicated after fork() system call. Therefore the Parent and Child processes will get the same image because they have same memory as original process.</p> <p>The difference between both processes is when the call returns. </p> <p>• If call returns in parent process, return value will be process id of child process. </p> <p>• If returns in child process then return value will be ‘0’.</p> <p>• If call fails and no new process created then return value will be -1.</p> <p>If process created successfully then parent and child process will run the code from the same place where fork() call was running, due to duplicate memory. There may be two possibilities:</p> <p>• The parent process ends before child process.</p> <p>• The child process ends before parent process.</p> <p> </p> <p>If wait() is called in some parent process then that process will be suspended until child ends.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Hence, the output of this program will be 5 at Line A. The child process updates only its copy of value and after that control will be returned to parent process in which the value of value is 5 hence print statements will print the value as 5. Wait()is used in parent process hence firstly child will end then parents execute. Therefore final value will be from parent process.</p></div>
