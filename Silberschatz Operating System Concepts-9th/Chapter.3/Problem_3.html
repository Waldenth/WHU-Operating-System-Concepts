<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Concurrent systems:</b> </p> <p>• Concurrent systems are those which support the concept of executing more than one applications or processes at the same time. Here the processes running can either be a duplicate of each other or simply two different processes in all. </p> <p>• The main motive behind going for concurrency lies beneath reducing the overall execution time that may be required in executing a series of processes individually.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Complications with Concurrency</b> </p> <p>Concurrency may reduce the overall processing time for some situations, but it has few of its complications as well. Three major complications that concurrency adds to an operating system are as follows:</p> <p>• As multiple processes are concurrently running on the system, the operating system requires keeping track of all the storage space addresses on main memory to prevent one process from mixing with another or using the information stored for any other running process.</p> <p>• Context switching between two simultaneous processes requires enough time to locate and maintain register values for programs running. A continuous communication between operating system and program control block may overload the system.</p> <p>• Process that requires big data blocks for execution may enter deadlocks in wait of getting resources freed up by other processes.</p></div>
