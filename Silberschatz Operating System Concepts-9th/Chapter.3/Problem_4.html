Context switch times are highly dependent on hardware support. In <b>Sun Ultra SPARC</b>, context switch simply requires the CPU current-register-set pointer is changed to the register set containing the new context, which takes very little time. </p> <p> <b>If the new context is in memory rather than register set</b> and all the register sets are in use, then one of the contexts in a register set must be chosen and be moved to memory, and the new context must be loaded from memory into the set. This process takes a little more time than on systems with new context is already on one of the register set.</p></div>
