<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> Handles are a standardized interface to all kinds of objects. Like a file descriptor in UNIX, an object handle is an identifier unique to a process that confers the ability to access and manipulate a system resource. Handles can be duplicated within a process, or between processes. The latter case is used when creating child processes or implementing out-of-process execution contexts.</p> <p> A process gets a handle by creating an object, by opening an existing object, by receiving a duplicated handle from another process, or by inheriting handle from a parent process, similar to the way a UNIX process gets a file descriptor. The object manager is the only entity that generates object handles.</p></div>
