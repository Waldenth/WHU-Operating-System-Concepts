<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Threads Suspend Count</b> </p> <p>Each process has multiple threads involved with it to handle the flow for the desired output. Windows associates suspend count to each thread created. The initial value of suspend count for each thread is zero. Based on the value of suspend count a thread is either executed or left in suspended mode. The thread having suspend count zero or less are executed or to be executed. If the thread has a suspend count above zero then it is left without execution.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The debugger, when attached to process, increases the suspend count for process threads by one. When a process ends and is detached from the debugger, suspend count is reduced by one. While the process is in the execution state, the suspend count of threads is temporarily reduced by one.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The suspend count for threads is used in windows while switching between processes executing multitasking. Suppose two different processes ‘A’ and ‘B’ received together for processing. To implement multi-tasking both processes should be executed together – switching between the two.</p> <p>When thread of process ‘A’ are executing the count for them becomes greater than zero, while for the threads of process ‘B’ are less than or equal to zero. So, the task is switched to process ‘B’ making the value of its threads greater than zero and threads of process ‘A’ are reduced back to zero.</p> <p>This way, the both the processes get time for execution, and multitasking is implemented.</p></div>
