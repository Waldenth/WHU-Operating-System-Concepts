<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>300-22-11E</p> <p> A process is an executing instance of an application, and a thread is a unit of code that can be scheduled by operating system. Thus a process contains one or more threads. A process is started when some other process calls the create process routine. This routine loads any dynamic link libraries used by the process, and creates a primary thread.</p> <p> The windows XP process manager provides services for creating, deleting, and using processes, threads, and jobs. CreateProcess() in the original process calls an API in the process manager to actually create the process. Once a new process is created, the initial thread is created, and an asynchronous procedure call is delivered to the thread to prompt to prompt the start of execution at user-mode image loader. The loader is link library which is automatically mapped into every newly created process.</p> <p> The process manager also implements the queuing and delivery of asynchronous procedure calls to threads.</p></div>
