<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Fiber and Thread Abstraction</b> </p> <p>Whenever a process is created for the execution of an application or a program, a thread or multiple threads (depending on the application requirement) are created for providing required resources to the application and Operating system and enabling proper management of the process, involving memory, resources and I/O.</p> <p>Fiber is similar to a thread. It also helps in linking process with the resources and memory management.</p> <p>The Fiber/threads are managed by the Memory manager and directly linked with the process termination. If a process is terminated without completing the task, then the fiber/threads which are linked with the process are also terminated auto. In windows 7 the user can view the count of threads working for a specific process using the Resource Monitor but cannot close a thread. As both threads and fibers used by a process are not available to the user they are termed as abstract.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Fiber and thread differ only in the scheduling styles. The threads use the preemptive scheduling mechanism and are implicit in style. The fibers use non-preemptive scheduling and are explicit in style. This difference results in giving kernel or the manager better control. Threads can be interrupted by the kernel or the program process while it is still in the running mode. Fibers can only be interrupted by the program process giving protection to the critical sections of the code running.</p> <p>Advantage of thread is that it prevents other threads to execute if one (of many) finds that the computation is not resulting in any yield required for process continuation. This makes a thread lighter and prevents CPU cycles wasted in processing the thread.</p> <p>Multiple threads can run on multiple cores at the same time whereas fiber does no execute parallel. Only one fiber for a process section is executed at given point of time.</p></div>
