<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>I/O manager responsibilities</b> </p> <p>The Input/output manager also known as I/O manager controls the flow of the process in association with other managers.</p> <p> <b>Device Driver</b> – the I/O manager keeps a track of the device drivers which are loaded and controls the filter drivers, to manage the buffer memory requests for any specific drive or process I/O. The I/O stack maintains a list of device drivers attached to each device. The device object represents a driver in the system as a single driver can work on multiple devices.</p> <p> <b>Memory Mapped file</b> - the I/O manager while handling the caching of the I/O system communicates with Windows Cache Manager and VM manager to provide links in the memory.</p> <p>A synchronous I/O queue is maintained while any of the I/O operation is in wait state, by the I/O manager. Any I/O request received is converted to standard form I/O request packet (IRP) by the I/O manager. For processing this IRP is sent to the first driver in the I/O stack. After processing of the IRP the I/O manager either sends the IRP to the next driver in the I/O stack or if the process gets over return to the process manager.</p> <p> <b>Filter Drivers</b> – when the I/O manager creates the I/O driver stack, then few drivers are inserted in the stack and they are called the filter drivers. I/O manager uses these filter drivers are given precedence over the file system and are used to provide the I/O flow to the system processes such as partition management or device mount management.</p></div>
