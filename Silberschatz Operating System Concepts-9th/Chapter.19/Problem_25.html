<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>KTs and UTs</b> </p> <p>Kernel Thread (KT) is also known as Light Weight Process (LWP). Kernel creates and schedules the KT. User Thread (UT) is not as expensive to create and to manage as KT. Creating KT is handled by the Kernel and is platform specific.</p> <p>The threading library creates the User Thread and schedules the calling of the thread as per the application inheriting the threading library. User Thread runs only in the user mode. When a process is executed by the user, then its corresponding user threads are created. User threads are portable in nature as they are user specific and handled by the user application.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>If the CPU is having single processor or uniprocessor system, then both User thread and Kernel Thread are executed and managed by respective originator. If the CPU has more than one processor, that is its using multiprocessor system, then a performance issue is seen due to handling of the threads.</p> <p>Different Kernel Threads can be executed on different CPUâ€™s as they are handled by the Kernel Scheduler. The User Thread, handled by the threading library can run on one processor but not on multiprocessor (that is they cannot be executed on parallel cores of the processor).</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>To manage the execution of User Threads different implementation models are as followed:</p> <p>1) Many-to-One: In many-to-one threading model, various User Threads are linked to One Kernel thread for implementation on parallel processor.</p> <p>2) One-To-One: In One-to-One threading model, Kernel Thread is linked with the User Thread directly. In this each KT is treated as a Virtual Process (VP). The Kernel Scheduler manages the VP.</p></div>
