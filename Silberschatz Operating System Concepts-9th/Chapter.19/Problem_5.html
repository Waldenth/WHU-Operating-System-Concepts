<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>2481-22-14E AID: 268</p> <p> RID: 944</p> <p> </p> <p> <b>Job of the object manager</b> </p> <p>Windows XP uses a generic set of interfaces to manage kernel-mode entities that are manipulated by user-mode programs. Windows XP calls these entities objects, and the executive component that manipulates them is the <i>object mange</i>. </p> <p>The main job of object manager is to organize the allocation and use of all managed objects. Object manager maintains the Window XP internal name space. In contrast to UNIX, which roots the system name space in the file system, Window XP uses an abstract name space and concepts the file system as device.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The object manager provides interfaces for defining both object types and object instances, translating names to objects, maintaining the abstract name space, and managing object creation and deletion. Objects are typically managed through the use of reference counts in protected-mode code and handles in user-mode code.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The object manager keeps track of two counts for each object. The pointer count is the number of distinct references made to an object. Protected-mode code that refers to objects must keep a reference on the objects to ensure that an object is not deleted while in use. The handle table entries referring to an object. Each handle is also reflected in the reference count.</p></div>
