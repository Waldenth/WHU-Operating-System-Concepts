<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Windows system hibernate</b> </p> <p>In windows operating system Hibernation is an option available to the user as a substitute to sleep mode. In sleep mode the computer stores the current state of the active tasks and unsaved documents in RAM. It consumes a unit of power to maintain this storage in the memory.</p> <p>In Hibernation mode, the current state of the active tasks and the unsaved documents are stored in the physical memory. System can be powered off after hibernation without losing on the state of the tasks or the unsaved data.</p> <p>When system is powered on, it checks for the Hiberfil.sys which has the settings for the hibernation state and pagefile.sys which stores the state of the process tasks and the unsaved data.</p> <p>A powered off system after hibernation is equivalent to a powered off system without hibernation. In a normal system, when it is turned off, RAM can be replaced without causing any change in the booting process after replacement; except for the performance speed depending on the type and size of RAM installed. Similarly, we can even replace the processor in a normal system when it is turned off; without affecting the windows booting process (except for the device drivers needed, if any) or the data stored. The only change seen is in the BIOS settings which will update the list of devices attached.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>These daysâ€™ external storage devices are used to boot the computer. These devices provide the space not only for the data, but also for the Operating system. System is turned power off after hibernate state saved in the external storage device and RAM + CPU changed while the system is powered off. As this external storage device was not even connected to the system while changes were made, hence no change in the files takes place. Upon starting of the system, the bios will look for any change in the hardware and will update the settings. The process states saved are independent of the CPU on which they are working or the RAM size.</p> <p>Hence after rebooting, post BIOS update, the system will regain itself from the hibernation state, affecting only the performance speed depending on the processor power and RAM type + size.</p></div>
