<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Deferred Procedure Calls</b> </p> <p>Every process executed in Windows 7 contains multiple threads to handle the program execution. The threads have multiple states of execution – Running, Runnable, Wait, Terminated, and Blocked.</p> <p>Windows Kernel maintains a queue for both Asynchronous Procedure Call (APC) and Deferred Procedure Call (DPC). While a thread is in the running or runnable state then it is in queue for APC interrupts.</p> <p>When a thread stops execution because either it has reached in the wait state or has terminated, the dispatcher is called by the kernel.</p> <p>If within many layers of code, the thread enters the wait or terminated state, and it is found by the kernel that rescheduling of the process thread should take place, and then kernel calls the dispatcher requesting it to defer till the current process is completed, which triggers a DPC interrupt.</p> <p>Whenever a deadlock state arises for a process making it “Not Responding,” then the windows Kernel uses the deferred procedure calls facility, to reschedule the process thread.</p> </div>

<div class="answer"> <p>The DPC states for execution are as shown in the figure below:</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/f2e/f2e0ef74-9903-4782-8240-c5f4d0b038f2/5644-22-14E-i1.png" alt="5644-22-14E" /> </p></div>
