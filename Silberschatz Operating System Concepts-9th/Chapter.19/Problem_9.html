<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Networking Protocols</b> </p> <p>The Client-Server architecture and Peer-to-Peer architecture for networking are both supported by windows 7. Both the architectures have a different outlook and working methodology.</p> <p> <b>Client - Server Architecture:</b> </p> <p>In client-server architecture the end user requests the server for data, resources before processing. The processing can be done either by the client system or by the server. The best example to explain client server architecture is Web site – especially free email sites like Gmail. The client (the email account user) accesses the home page of the service provider – Gmail. When client enters the details (username and password) then the information is sent to the server for authentication. Server processes the information and upon authenticating responds back to the client with access to the emails.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The diagram given below shows the link between client and server in client-server architecture.</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/4b9/4b9e709e-35fc-4565-ab3e-8fb6715d96c2/5644-22-9PE-i1.png" alt="5644-22-9PE_1" /> </p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The client-server architecture starts working sooner the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is triggered. The server is sent a request stating that a client is requesting for the home page and server responds back with the home page (if user is authorized). Similarly, whenever any download request is sent from the client, then too the client-server architecture for network is executed.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>In client-server architecture, the server can respond to multiple users at the same time. When a client is added to the server the load on the server increases; for server needs to cater the needs of each client.</p> <p>When the number of clients requesting from server crosses the limit for number of clients which server can handle, then the website crashes, and become inaccessible.</p> <p>The diagram given below shows the links between clients and server in client-server architecture.</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/ccc/cccf738f-5511-4b37-a624-1a3d3115866a/5644-22-9PE-i2.png" alt="5644-22-9PE_2" /> </p> </div>
<h2>Step-5</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>P2P Architecture</b> </p> <p>In peer to peer architecture, also known as P2P architecture, server is involved with the client – similar to the client-server architecture. The difference is that in P2P the client does not necessarily need to wait for the server to reply for the request but sends the request to all available clients. Any client which can cater to the needs of another client does so reducing the load on the server.</p> <p>In another way it can be said that in P2P architecture each client who is responding to request of any other client is labelled as server, though not exactly having features of a server.</p> <p>The P2P architecture can be shown by the diagram as shown below:</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/38b/38b2bdec-9cd9-46b7-b27a-b4833fcdf06f/5644-22-9PE-i3.png" alt="5644-22-9PE_3" /> </p> </div>
<h2>Step-6</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is the protocol suit which is used by default by all networking tasks. TCP/IP is way ahead in use over other networking protocols.</p> <p>To maintain networking architecture, Windows 7 also has IPX/SPX and NetBEUI protocols. The protocol IPX/SPX is used to share the resources over the network. IPX/SPX is used for file and printer sharing over the network.</p> <p>Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is the protocol suit having various networking protocols which work at different layers in the network model. To name a few – in Application layer (DHCP, FTP, POP, SMTP etc), Transport layer (TCP, UDP etc.)</p> <p>Two protocols FTP and DHCP are explained below:</p> <p>1) File Transfer protocol (FTP) – is part of the protocol suit. It is used when two computers on a network need to exchange files. It allows sharing of files through remote computers. It maintains a privacy of users sharing same file. It is also efficient and reliable in data transfer.</p> <p>2) Dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) – is used to dynamically assign the IP address to the computers on a network. The IP’s are allocated from a pool of IP address to each machine connecting to the network. The IP address is released sooner the machine goes off the network. This entire process is managed by the DHCP on the client machine and the DHCP settings of the server in the client-server networking architecture.</p></div>
