<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Windows kernel architecture</b> </p> <p>Windows kernel is a link between the computer hardware and application software. Its basic work is to manage the security levels, manage the virtual memory space usage, and multiple threads created for the execution of tasks without creating a deadlock condition.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Windows kernel has three main layers in its architecture, which are:</p> <p>a. Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)</p> <p>b. Kernel</p> <p>c. Executive Layer</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Explanation</b>:</p> <b>Hardware Abstraction Layer</b> - HAL is a software layer which is in direct contact with the hardware of the computer system. HAL provides a non-real hardware interface to be used by the device drivers and the executive layer. The device is directly accessed by the device driver after being mapped. Other requirements which involve the chipset details like handling I/O buses, memory mapping, DMA are all handled by the HAL itself. </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Kernel</b> – The basic role of Kernel is to handle the interrupts and exceptions along with scheduling the process and its threads and communicating between the user and Kernel. For every executable code there is a process assigned and with that process multiple related threads are executed. The purpose of Kernel is to handle these threads and keep a watch on any interrupt or exception caused due to these threads. It manages the various stages of the thread execution and the process flow accordingly.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-5</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Executive Layer</b> – The executive layer of the windows kernel provides support and services to the subsystems for all the users. It handles the virtual memory for each subsystem, manages the processes, handles all the procedure calls creating an interrupt, and other system managements like plug and play, registry, and cache.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-6</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The diagram given below shows the three architectural layers in the Kernel. </p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/f49/f4937abd-0cd4-463d-9349-872578b1af69/5644-22-4PE-i1.png" alt="5644-22-4PE" /> </p></div>
