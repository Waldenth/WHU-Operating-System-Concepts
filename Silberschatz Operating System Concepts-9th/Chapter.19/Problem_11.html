<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>New Technology File System</b> </p> <p>The NTFS file system is designed for many futures, including data recovery, security, fault tolerance, large files and file systems, multiple data streams, and so on. The NTFS does not deal with individual sectors of a disk but instead uses clusters as the units of disk allocation. </p> <p> <b>Data structure handling by NTFS:</b> </p> <p>Every file in the NTFS is described by one or more records in an array stored in a special file called the master file table. The size of a record is determined when the file system is created and the size ranges from 1 to 4 KB. In the NTFS system, before the data structure is altered, transactions write a log record containing redo and undo information. </p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The NTFS namespace is organized as a hierarchy of directories. Each of these directories uses a data structure called a B+ tree to store an index of the file name in that directory. NTFS uses B+ trees because the length of every path from the root of the tree to a leaf is the same and the cost of reorganization of the tree is eliminated.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>NTFS recovery from a system crash:</b> </p> <p>For recover NTFS processes the log records, first redoing operations for committed transactions and undoing operations for transactions that did not commit successfully before the crash.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>The things guaranteed after recovery:</b> </p> <p>There is no guarantee that all user file contents are correct after recovery, because the file contents are modified based on log file after a recovery. It ensures only that the file system data structures are undamaged and reflects some consistent state. </p></div>
