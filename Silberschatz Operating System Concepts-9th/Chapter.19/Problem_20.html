<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>300-22-10E</p> <p> Every file in NTFs is described by one or more records in an array stored in a special file called the master file table (MFT). The MFT is located at the beginning of the partition. Normally MFT takes up 1 MB. The size of a record is determined when the file is created; it ranges from 1 to 4KB. Small attributes stored in MFT record itself are called resident attributes and large attributes stored in one or more contiguous extents on the disk are called non-resident attributes. Each file in an NTFS volume has a unique ID called a file reference. The file reference is a 64-bit quantity that consists of 48-bit file number and a 16-bit sequence number.</p> <p> UNIX file system uses information nodes or inodes. Inode 0 contains the root of the file system. The file system is identified by the superblock which contains information about the layout of blocks, sectors, and cylinder groups on the file system. The inode does not contain a filename. Directory entry can point to the same node. A hard link makes it possible for file names to appear in several directories under several names.</p></div>
