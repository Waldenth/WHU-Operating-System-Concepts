<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Windows memory allocation</b> </p> <p>When windows computer starts, memory is allocated to the Operating system and the Virtual memory manager starts managing the memory to support the user and computer needs.</p> <p>Every program running in windows uses memory space. The disk storage space is used to store the program in the hard disk drive. While executing the program is allocated memory space in RAM and in Cache memory space. If the program is heavy on RAM memory space, then it is allocated virtual memory space for smooth and uninterrupted running of the program.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The figure below shows memory management process.</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/7dc/7dc354f9-0adf-421c-8019-3eaa28b0be32/5644-22-12PE-i1.png" alt="5644-22-12PE_b" /> </p> <p>The virtual memory actually acts as a buffer RAM for the program process and makes space in RAM for other processes. This can be explained better as â€“ suppose the user is having a 1080p full HD print for any movie in Blu Ray. User wants to watch the movie on the computer. The computer has 4 Gigabytes of RAM. The movie size on the Blu Ray is 64 Gigabytes.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>When the movie is played in the Windows Media Player, then a part of the RAM is allocated to the player to run the movie. If complete free RAM is allocated to the Media player, then there is no more space left for any other process to run.</p> <p>Smartly windows allocate space, known as Virtual Memory, in the hard disk drive which is used to provide the movie bits to the player, as memory-mapped files. This Virtual Memory also maintains threads linked to the original memory space where the file is stored, as local thread.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The figure below shows how the virtual memory works.</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/87e/87eef183-270d-4299-b118-10ad811a9f82/5644-22-12PE-i2.png" alt="5644-22-12PE" /> </p></div>
