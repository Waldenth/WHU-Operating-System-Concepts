<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Page Table Pages</b> </p> <p>The most recently used mappings are stored in a cache memory managed by the Memory management (VM manager). This cache block of memory is known as Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB). TBL is also known as the associative cache memory block.</p> <p>The TLB is first searched when a translation is needed for the virtual address to physical address. When a value is found in the TLB, the corresponding physical address is returned and the link is transferred to the physical address. If the value is not found in the TLB the link is searched for the mapping address in the page table. If value exists in the page table then it is written in the TLB.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Hence using TLB the VM manager maintains the page table and the virtual memory. The figure shown below shows the control flow for TLB and the Page table.</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/1b7/1b7973ed-95ac-4de8-85de-0b6c634f3c7f/5644-22-27E-i1.png" alt="5644-22-27E" /> </p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The active pages of the page table are stored in the RAM, whereas the inactive block of pages is still stored on the hard disk of the system.</p></div>
