<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The design of Virtual Memory manager assumes that the underlying hardware supports virtual to physical mapping, a paging mechanism, and transparent cache coherence on multiprocessor systems and allows multiple page-table entries to map to the same physical page frame. The Virtual Memory Manager in Window XP uses a page – based management scheme with a page size of 4KB an IA32-compatible processor and 8KB on the IA64. The Windows XP VM manager uses a two-step process to allocate user memory. The first step reserves a portion of the process’s virtual address space. The second step commits the allocation by assigning virtual memory space. Windows XP limits the amount of virtual memory space a process consumes by enforcing a quota on committed memory.</p> <p> For performance, VM Manager allows a privileged process to lock selected pages in physical memory, thus ensuring the pages are not paged out to the paging file.</p></div>
