<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>300-22-6E</p> <p>Local Procedure Call (LPC) facility is used pass requests and result between client and server processes within a single machine. LPC is used to request service form the various Window XP subsystem. Three message-passing technique are.</p> <p>1. Firstly, suitable for small message. In this case, port’s message queue is used as intermediate storage, and the message are copied from one process to other.</p> <p>2. Secondly, for larger message. Here shared memory section object is created for the channel. Message set through the port’s message queue contains a pointer and size information referring to section object. This avoids the need to copy larger messages. The sender places data into the shared section and receive views them directly.</p> <p>3. APIs are used, which reads and writes directly into a process’s address space.</p> <p>When a client asks for a connection that uses window-manager messaging, the server sets up three objects:</p> <p>1. a dedicated server thread to handle requests</p> <p>2. a 64-KB section object</p> <p>3. an event-pair object</p> <p>The section object passes the messages, and the event-pair object performs synchronization.</p></div>
