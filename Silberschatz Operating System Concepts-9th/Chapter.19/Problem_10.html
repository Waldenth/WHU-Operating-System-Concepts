<div class="answer"> <p> <b>NTFS namespace</b> </p> <p>The New Technology File System (NTFS) supports encryption of volume or individual files, and uses ACLâ€™s to control access for the same. Many other features are implemented on the files by the NTFS, like fault tolerance, file compression.</p> <p>In the NTFS namespace, directories are stored in the hierarchical patter similar to <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/249/2495bc35-ebaf-4d78-99d3-090776352b96/5644-22-10PE-i1.png" /> tree of Data Structure. In B+ tree the top most node contain its child nodes, similarly in NTFS the files or sub-directories in one directory are maintained as child of that specific directory.</p> <p>The traversal from the root node to the leaf node gives the path for the leaf element from the index root. Each entry in the NTFS namespace B+ directory node contains the name and reference of the file, along with the time stamp of the file and its size. All the details regarding the file name, time stamp, size, and file reference are available in the directory tree, reducing the need of the Master File Table (MFT) access each time a file is accessed.</p></div>
