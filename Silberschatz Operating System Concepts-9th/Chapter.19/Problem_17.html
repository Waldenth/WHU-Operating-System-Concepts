<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>No-Access Page</b> </p> <p>The virtual memory manager in windows handles the memory locations, paging facility in windows, and the virtual address links for paging facility.</p> <p>Some part of the memory is reserved for internal functions of the operating system. Remaining portion of the memory is free for applications which are executed on the system. The memory manager handles the links between the memory, virtual memory, and the physical memory.</p> <p>Stacks are maintained to manage the locations allocated for the application memory, OS sector in the memory, virtual memory to manage the paging. If an application tries to access a memory link causing overflow condition in the stack, then the windows kernel triggers the no-access page facility.</p> <p>No-access page facility is executed to prevent file from getting corrupt. The no access page facility is also used when connection to the external memory location is lost causing the virtual memory to trigger DPC which closes the application to release the memory â€“ making it reusable.</p></div>
