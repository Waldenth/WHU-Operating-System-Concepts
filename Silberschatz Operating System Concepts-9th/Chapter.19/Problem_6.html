<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Process Manager Services</b> </p> <p>A process is created for every executable code and application along with the related threads handling the process. All the stages of a process and its related threads are handled by the process manager and process manager provides services for the same.</p> <p>Various stages of a process managed by the process manager are:</p> <p>a. Creating a process</p> <p>b. Using the process</p> <p>c. Managing the threads</p> <p>d. Remove the process</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Services involved in the various stages of a process managed by the process manager are as given below:</p> <p>The process manager is involved only in the execution of the process but is not at all related to the <b>process hierarchy</b>. The process manager cannot schedule a process but can change the <b>priority</b> of the process (or its related threads) depending on the interrupts raised.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Another service provided by the process manager is to implement <b>Asynchronous procedure calls</b> for the threads related to the process. Process manager creates a queue for the threads. The process manager also manages service to handle the <b>local procedure call</b> (LPC). LPC is a bridge to pass the request from client to server process and result from server process to client process.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>A thread can be allocated to a different process when in the executive layer. To manage this shift in the thread the process manager supports <b>impersonation</b> service. The process manager assigns a <b>security token</b> to each thread. The token assigned contains the <b>security identity</b> (SID) of the user authenticated by the login process.</p></div>
