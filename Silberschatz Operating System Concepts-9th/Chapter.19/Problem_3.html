<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Windows 7 Booting process</b> </p> <p>The process of getting a computer, soon power is turned on, into a state ready for accepting the input from the user and/or executing the applications is known as booting. The booting process is executed in steps one after the other.</p> <p>Sooner the power is turned on; computer performs a self-test known as power-on self-test (POST). In <b>POST</b> the computer detects the devices which are attached and ready for use.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>After detection of the devices, disk is searched from which the <b>BOOTMGR</b> program is executed. The <b>BOOTMGR</b> program checks if any hibernation state for the system is saved. If hibernation state is found then the program <b>WINRESUME</b> is loaded to restore.</p> <p> <b>BOOTMGR</b> checks the Boot Configuration Data for mounts and extracts the boot information. After BCD mounts the control is passed to <b>WINLOAD</b> program.</p> <p>The <b>WINLOAD</b> program loads the <b>NTOSKRNL</b> and <b>HAL.DLL</b> programs along with the system hive which stores details of the system registry and boot drivers.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The initialize the system kernel program <b>NTOSKRNL</b> uses two phases. In the <b>phase 0</b>, the display driver for the system is initialized. The <b>phase 1</b> sets the time bias and further calls <b>SMSS</b> program.</p> <p> <b>NTOSKRNL</b> passes the control to <b>SMSS</b> the session manager subsystem. <b>SMSS</b> loads the device drivers, establishes the paging files for the system and manages the sessions for the windows logged-in users. <b>SMSS</b> also maintains a special session for maintaining the system services such as <b>LSASS</b>. Each <b>SMSS</b> session except for the one which is handling background services, runs the <b>WINLOGON</b> process. Each <b>WINLOGON</b> process is launched when a user logs in and corresponding <b>EXPLORER</b> process is executed.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The booting process flow for windows 7 is as shown below.</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/747/747d0d15-2b1e-45ac-a4e2-0e9aacf3c763/5644-22-3PE-i1.png" alt="5644-22-3PE" /> </p></div>
