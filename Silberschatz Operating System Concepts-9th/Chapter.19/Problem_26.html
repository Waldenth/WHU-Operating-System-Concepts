<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Virtual Address Space</b> </p> <p>In Operating system the virtual memory manager, maintains the flow of process and handles the interrupts; swapping memory between different I/O units. When a process is executed; the application is occupied in the hard disk space, from where it starts execution. The execution takes place in the RAM. From RAM the data and control is transferred as per the need of the process.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The flow of the process is shown in the diagram below:</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/141/14157c12-e49f-4ab4-8d47-e12af02f5d4b/5644-22-26E-i1.png" alt="5644-22-26E" /> </p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The allocation of the virtual memory is managed by the windows VM manager in two simple steps:</p> <p>1. Step one block the space (pages) in the virtual address space of the process.</p> <p>2. Step two confirms the allocation by assigning virtual memory space. This virtual memory space can be either the physical memory or the space in the paging file.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The memory layout for a windows process is shown in the figure below:</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/f2a/f2adfab6-dc1b-4110-9996-9080a6b4f89a/5644-22-26E-i2.png" alt="5644-22-26E_b" /> </p> </div>
<h2>Step-5</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>When paging is done for a process, it is allocated a limited space from the virtual memory. This allocation of the virtual memory is dependent on the processor type. The VM manager maintains the flow from virtual memory to the process and to the physical memory. This process has to be constantly maintained. The page table maintained by the VM manager is used to store the process ID, the link of the virtual address, the address at the physical memory. This page table has the entire flow requirement for the process and the memory addresses.</p> <p>When process is having high priority, then instead of expanding the allocation of the virtual memory, the link addresses in the page table are increased, which increases the use of virtual address space but not the virtual memory.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-6</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The page table relation between the virtual memory and the main memory is as given below:</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/a21/a2121ed6-ce06-48b2-b6be-5ba5a529dcf4/5644-22-26E-i3.png" alt="5644-22-26E_c" /> </p></div>
