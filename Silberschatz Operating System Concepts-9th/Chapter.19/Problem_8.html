<div class="answer"> <p>2481-22-17E AID: 268</p> <p> RID: 944</p> <p> </p> <p> <b>Responsibilities of I/O manager</b> </p> <p>The main responsibilities of I/O manager are</p> <p>• File systems</p> <p>• Device drivers</p> <p>• Network drivers</p> <p>It keeps track of which device drivers, filter drivers, and file systems are loaded, and it also manages buffers for I/O requests. It works with the virtual memory manager to provide memory-mapped file I/O and controls the windows XP cache manager, which handles caching for the entire I/O system.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The I/O manager is fundamentally asynchronous, providing synchronous I/O by explicitly waiting for an I/O operation to complete. The I/O manager provides several models of asynchronous I/O completion, including setting of events, delivery of APCs to initiating threads, and use of I/O completion ports, which allows a single thread to process I/O completions from many other threads.</p></div>
