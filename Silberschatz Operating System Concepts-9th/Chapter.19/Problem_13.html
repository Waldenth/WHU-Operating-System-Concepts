<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Different ways an application can use memory via the Windows32 API:</b> </p> <p>The Win32 API provides several ways for an application to use memory. They are</p> <p>1. Virtual Memory</p> <p>2. Memory-Mapping Files</p> <p>3. Heaps</p> <p>4. Thread-Local Storage</p> <p>1) Virtual memory provides several functions like VirtualAlloc(), VirtualFree(), Virtual Lock(), SetProcessWorkingSetSize() that allow an application to reserve, release, to perform other memory operations and to specifying the virtual address at which the memory is allocated. </p> <p>2) An application can use memory by Memory-Mapping a file address space, providing a means for two processes to share memory. It is a multistage process.</p> <p>3) Applications can also use Heaps to use memory. If Win32 process is initialized, then it is created with a default heap. There are several functions like HeapCreate(), HeapAlloc(), etc., for heap-management in Win32 API. Private heaps can be created to provide regions of reserved address space for applications. </p> <p>4) A thread-local storage mechanism provides a way for global and static data to work properly in a multithreaded environment. It provides both dynamic and static methods of creating thread-local storage. Thread-lock storage allocates global storage on a per-thread basis. </p></div>
