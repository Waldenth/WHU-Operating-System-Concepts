<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Evolution of Operating System</b> </p> <p>A various types of operating systems have evolved by the time and according to the changing requirement of the user. The evolution of the operating system is discussed below:</p> <p>• The early computers were made to use <b>batch</b> <b>operating</b> <b>system</b>, in which the system used to run many jobs without any halt. Programs were punched to cards which were copied to <b>tape</b> for other processing. Whenever the one job was finished, other was started on the tape.</p> <p>• <b>Time</b> <b>shared</b> operating system replaced batch operating system. Now the users could interact with the system with the help of a printing terminal.</p> <p>• The <b>Atlair</b> <b>8800</b> was the first personal computer given to individuals. It was sold in kit form to users and it did not have an operating system as it contained only switches and light emitting diodes to give the input and to receive the output.</p> <p>• The <b>graphical</b> <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> (GUI) computers were the systems having displays with bit mapped pixels. The first success of such kind of computer was <b>Apple</b> <b>Macintosh</b> introduced in 1984.</p> <p>The conclusion about the evolution of operating system is that systems evolved as according to the need of user and provided them more secure, scalable and systems with good user interface.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Some operating system became popular as they were suitable for various types of requirements and they were compatible with <b>mini</b> <b>computers</b>, <b>microcomputers</b>, and <b>mainframe</b> <b>computers</b>. Other operating system failed because they were not able to run thousands of applications simultaneously and were not easy to use, also they dint provide security to users and good graphical user interface.</p></div>
