<div class="answer"> <p>• CTSS is The Compatible Time-Sharing Operating System designed at MIT. This OS was implemented on the processor of IBM 7090. It was designed to support 32 interactive users. Set of Interactive commands are given to users which can be used to modify files and also for compiling and running programs.</p> <p>• The CPU Scheduling is implemented using multilevel feedback queue algorithm. According to this algorithm <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/702/7027be6a-6dce-4c85-8278-032927957243/13258-20-4E-i1.png" />amount of time units are allocated as the time quantum for level <i>i</i>. </p> <p>• If a given program does not finish its CPU burst in one quantum time, then it is moved down one level of the queue and hence giving it <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/151/15154669-0ebb-400b-ac0f-0ccaa7fbe998/13258-20-4E-i2.png" />quantum of time. The program at the topmost level is the one with least quantum and hence runs first. </p> <p>• The level of the program is determined by the size initially, so that the time quantum should be at least as long as the swap time. </p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Thus, if a multilevel feedback queue as used in CTSS and MULTICS is considered then assuming that a program takes 7 time units each time it executes an I/O Operation and blocks and it is at level <i>i</i>, then time allocation will be as follows, according to the algorithm above:</p> <p>For level 2, Time quantum is <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/fd0/fd00f55b-d189-4620-86ad-5d97e9f6da9a/13258-20-4E-i3.png" />Time Units.</p> <p>For level 3, Time quantum is <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/8cf/8cfe16fa-b343-4b5a-bc5d-d87c5b53b123/13258-20-4E-i4.png" />Time Units.</p> <p>For level 4, Time quantum is <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/5b9/5b9c2f6d-ac96-4ce7-9d0d-2dc77cd0b415/13258-20-4E-i5.png" />Time Units.</p></div>
