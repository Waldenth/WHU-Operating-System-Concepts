<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Mach Operating System</b> </p> <p>Mach operating system was designed to fulfill the following conditions:</p> <p>1) To make the files of UNIX system executable under Mach operating system.</p> <p>2) It was establish as modern operating system that supports many memory models for parallel and distributed computing.</p> <p>3) It used a kernel that was simpler and easier to do modifications than 4.3 <b>BSD (Berkley Software Design).</b></p> <p>In the second release of Mach it included much of the <b>BSDâ€™</b>s code inside the kernel. This new release of Mach made kernels larger than the kernels of BSD. Mach 3 removed the BSD code outside of the kernel and thus giving a very small microkernel. This new Mach 3 evicted all <b>UNIX</b> specific code so that is can run in user mode servers. After the eviction of the UNIX specific code from the kernel it allowed the replacement of BSD with any other operating system.</p> <p>User mode implementation in BSD has been developed for DOS which is <b>Machintosh</b> operating system. This concept is similar to the virtual machine concept. But this virtual machine is defined by software here rather than hardware which ensure the efficient handling of messages. Mach provides great flexibility in the design and in managing the memory object tasks.</p></div>
