<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>300-23-2E</p> <p>Each new I/O device had its own characteristics, requiring careful programming. A special subroutine called a device driver was written for each I/O device, CPU can often be idle. The problem is the speed of the mechanical I/O devices, which are slower than electronic device. Even a slow CPU works in the micro second, with thousands of instruction executed per second. The difference in speed between CPU and its I/O device may be three orders of magnitude or more.</p> <p>Earlier one solution for this problem was to replace slow card readers and line printers (I/O devices mostly used then) with magnetic-tape units. Rather than have CPU read directly from cards, however the cards were first copied onto a magnetic tape via a separate device. When the tape was successfully full, it was taken down and carried over to the computer. When a card was needed for input to a program, the equivalent record was read from the tape. Similarly, output was written to the tape, and the contents of the tape were printed later. The card readers and the line printers were operated off-line, rather than by the main computer.</p></div>
