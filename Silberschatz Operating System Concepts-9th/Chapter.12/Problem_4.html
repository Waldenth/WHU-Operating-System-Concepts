<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Allocation methods</b> </p> <p> <b>Contiguous Allocation</b>: under this approach, files on the disk occupy contiguous blocks. This type of allocation is well suited when a file needs to be accessed sequentially. The access time would be small as the file would be stored in a set of contiguous blocks. This allocation scheme is useful for smaller files.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Linked allocation</b>: using this approach, a linked list of blocks scattered over the disk is used to store a file. This approach should be followed to store large files which are to be accessed in a sequential manner since each block is linked to another block in the linked list of blocks.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Indexed allocation</b>: This scheme uses an index block for each file containing the block addresses on the disk. This approach is useful for random access. File which need large disk space and need random access should be stored using this approach.</p></div>
