<div class="answer"> <p>The following table shows the performance of <b>contiguous, linked, indexed</b> technique for allocating disk blocks for both random and sequential file access. </p> <p> </p> <table border="1" style="border-collapse:collapse;"> <tr> <td> <p> <b>Contiguous Disk Allocation</b> </p> </td> <td> <p> <b>Linked-List Allocation</b> </p> </td> <td> <p> <b>Indexed Allocation</b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>The name contiguous disk allocation suggests itself; a contiguous disk memory allocation technique provides an immediate way of storing file blocks. </p> </td> <td> <p>In this technique, the file blocks on a disk come up with a pointer towards successor block. </p> <p>. </p> </td> <td> <p>As the name suggests, this technique makes use of a unique index that helps in locating any file block with a single glance. </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>The allocation is performed speedily, and hence the user has to mention file size in advance. </p> </td> <td> <p>In this pointer has nothing else than address for the next file block on the disk, so it forms up a linked-list</p> </td> <td> <p>Similar, as contiguous allocation method user here needs to specify the file size in advance and the file mapping system runs a search for the location that is bigger enough to handle current file. </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Contiguous allocation method provides faster <b>sequential access</b>.</p> </td> <td> <p>Being far different from contiguous disk allocation method, linked-list has a dark side for <b>sequential access. </b></p> </td> <td> <p>In this allocation technique, <b>sequential and random</b> accesses both take minimum time span to locate a file block.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>The efforts for calculating <b>random disk</b> location is minimized in this technique; as all it needs is just adding an offset entry to the first block location of the file.</p> </td> <td> <p>The reason behind failure towards sequential access lies beneath the lack of contiguous blocks. Similarly, the need of performing several sequential searches makes <b>random access</b> complex.</p> </td> <td> <p>In this allocation technique, <b>sequential and random</b> accesses both take minimum time span to locate a file block. Any increase in file size is adaptable but may particularly require updating the index array.</p> </td> </tr> </table> <p> <b> </b> </p></div>
