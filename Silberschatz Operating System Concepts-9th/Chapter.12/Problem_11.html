<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>An important variant on linked allocation is the use of a file-allocation table (FAT). A section of disk at the beginning of each volume is set a side to contain the table. The table has one entry for each disk block and is indexed by block number. The directory entry contains the block number of the first block of file. The table entry indexed by that block number contains the block number of the next block in file. This chain continues until the last block, which has a special-end-of file value as the table entry. Unused blocks are indicated by a 0 table value. Advantage is that random-access time is improved, because the disk head can find the location of any block by reading the information in FAT.</p></div>
