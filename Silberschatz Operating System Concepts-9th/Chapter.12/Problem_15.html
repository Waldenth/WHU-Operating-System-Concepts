<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>a.</b> </p> <p>Consider the logical and physical block size of a file system is 512 bytes.</p> <p>General procedure to map the logical address to the physical address is an addition of logical address with the displacement address. The resultant will give the location of the physical memory.</p> <p>Procedure of mapping the logical address to physical address system by the three allocation techniques is as follows:</p> <p> <b>Note: Assume the starting address of the file be the Z.</b> </p> <p> <b>Contiguous allocation technique:</b> </p> <p>• Divide the logical address by the block size of 512 bytes with R as the remainder and Q as the quotient respectively.</p> <p>• Now, add the quotient Q to Z. This will give the location of the physical block number.</p> <p>• The remainder R is the displacement number into the block.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Linked Allocation technique:</b> </p> <p>• In linked allocation, each block contains a pointer (address) to the next block. Therefore, user can simply read the blocks by following the pointers to access the files. Each block has a free-space to store the data as well as pointer. But, the pointer is not visible to the user.</p> <p>• The mapping of logical to physical address is divide the logical physical address by the block size of 511 bytes (assume the pointer size is 1 byte and it is not visible) with Q as the quotient and R as the remainder.</p> <p>• Uncover the linked list to getting the Q+1 block. This means, Q+1 will give the address of the next block.</p> <p>• The remainder R+1 will give the displacement into the last physical block number.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Indexed Allocation technique:</b> </p> <p>• Index file allocation has an index which maintains an array of disk-block addresses to access the required file.</p> <p>• Mapping of logical to physical address is divide the logical address by the block size of 512 bytes with Q as the quotient and R as the remainder.</p> <p>• First, place the index block into the memory. This has an array of address.</p> <p>• The location of the quotient Q in the index will give the location of the physical block address.</p> <p>• The remainder R is the displacement into the desired physical block location.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>b.</b> </p> <p>The calculation of number of physical blocks read from the disk is shown as follows:</p> <p> <b>Contiguous allocation technique:</b> </p> <p>The contiguous allocation defines the addresses in linear order on the disk. As the current logic block is 10 and wants to access the logical block 4, simply 1 physical block accessing is needed to read form the disk. </p> <p>Therefore, there is a need of <b>1</b><b> </b>physical block to read from the disk.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-5</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Linked Allocation technique:</b> </p> <p>It uses pointers to move from one block to another block. The current logical block is 10 and wants to access logical block 4, it simply moves the 4 locations in the linked list.</p> <p>Therefore, there is a need of <b>4</b> physical blocks to read from the disk.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-6</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Indexed Allocation technique:</b> </p> <p>It maintains an index of addresses to access the blocks. The last block accessed is 10 and wants to access the block 4, it just checks the index of 10 and 4.</p> <p>Therefore, there is a need of <b>2 </b>physical blocks to read from the disk.</p></div>
