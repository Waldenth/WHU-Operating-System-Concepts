<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Cache</b> </p> <p>Caches improve performance by holding the data which are frequently used. They allow enable communication between different components which may have variable speeds. The communication is more effective using caches as the data from the device with a lower speed is temporarily stored in the cache.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The cache size is usually limited because caches are much more expensive than other storage devices. Hence, as the size of the cache increases, the cost increases as well. Thus, using larger caches would increase the cost of the system.</p></div>
