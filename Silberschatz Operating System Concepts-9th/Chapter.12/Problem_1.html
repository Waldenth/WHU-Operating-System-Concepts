<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>b.</b> </p> <p> <b>The block is added in the middle:</b> </p> <p> <b>Contiguous allocation:</b> </p> <p>The file contains 100 blocks.

<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>c.</b> </p> <p> <b>The block is added at the end:</b> </p> <p> <b>Contiguous allocation:</b> </p> <p>If the user wants to add a new block at the end, it just accesses the last block and add the new block.</p> <p>Therefore, only 1 disk I/O operation is required.</p> <p> <b>Linked allocation:</b> </p> <p>If the user wants to add a block at the end, it moves to end of the linked list.

<h2>Step-5</h2>
<div class="answer">Therefore, 1operation required to move the end of the list and adding of new block requires 1 operation, 1 operation to points to the next block.</p> <p>Therefore, total 3 disc I/O operations are required.</p> <p> <b>Indexed allocation:</b> </p> <p>In this allocation, one operation is required to add new block at end.

<h2>Step-8</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>e.</b> </p> <p> <b>The block is removed from the middle:</b> </p> <p> <b>Contiguous allocation:</b> </p> <p>The user needs to move the first 50 blocks to remove one block in the middle.

<h2>Step-9</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>f.</b> </p> <p> <b>The block is removed from the end:</b> </p> <p> <b>Contiguous allocation:</b> </p> <p>It does not require I/O operations to remove at the end.

<h2>Step-10</h2>
<div class="answer">In this allocation, the last block is directly removed because the blocks can be accessed directly in the indexed accessing. </p> <p>Therefore, it doesn’t require any operations. </p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/media/393/s583x155/3932f576-3d37-4226-9fbf-e22564945a48/13258-12-1PE-i6.png" alt="Picture 15" /> </p></div>
