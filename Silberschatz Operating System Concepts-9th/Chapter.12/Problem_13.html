<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>If disk space is used as eight 512-byte blocks or single 4-KB block, the file system memory is swapping in and out, means the internal fragmentation can be reduced. </p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>To improve the performance of flexibility to the file system. The first memory is allocated as a single 4-KB block and two contiguous 512-bye blocks. In addition to the blocks, there is a bitmap of a free block to maintain the state of the subblocks which is currently used inside the block.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The modifications to be done to support the file allocate system feature is the file allocator block is examining the extra state to allocate subblocks and then combine to form the subblocks to obtain the single larger block when all the subblocks become free.</p></div>
