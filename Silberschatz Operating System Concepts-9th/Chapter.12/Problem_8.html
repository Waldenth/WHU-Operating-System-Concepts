<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Virtual file systems</b> </p> <p>A virtual file system (VFS) layer separates the operations specific to file systems from their respective implementations using the VFS interface. It is used to represent a file uniquely over a network. It achieves this indirection in a fashion similar to the object-oriented techniques in programming. </p> <p>Generic system calls can be made to different file systems. The data structures and function calls of all file systems are provided to the VFS layer. Then, when a system call is made, it is translated first into functions which are specific to the desired file system. The program which initiated this system call does not use any code specific to a file-system. Thus, the structures are independent of the file-system. When the system call is translated at the virtual file system layer, they are translated specific to their respective file systems.</p> <p>This is how a VFS layer supports multiple file systems-types.</p></div>
