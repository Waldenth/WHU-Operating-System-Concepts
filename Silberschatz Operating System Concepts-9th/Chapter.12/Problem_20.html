<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>A user may notice that a particular file is either missing or corrupted long after the damage was done. Hence a plan is done to take a full backup from time to time that will be saved forever rather than reusing that backup medium. It is good to store these permanent backups far away from the regular backups to protect against hazard. It is not possible to restore any data from backups. This contrasts to the schedule given in Section 11.7.2 by having all subsequent backups.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> To minimize the copying needed, we can use information from each file’s directory entry. For instance, if the backup program knows when the last backup of a file was done, and the file’s last written date in the directory indicates that the file has not changed since that date, then the file does not need to copy again.</p> <p> Restore is easier because we can go to the last backup, rather than the full tape. More tape is used as more file changes, no intermediate tapes to need be read. </p></div>
