<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>2481-11-9E SA: 8683</p> <p> SR: 6376</p> <p> The bit map used for file allocation must be kept on mass storage, rather than in main memory, <b>because bit vectors are inefficient unless the entire vector is kept in main memory.</b> Keeping it in main memory is possible for smaller disks, such as on microcomputers, but not for larger ones. A 1.3 GB disk with 512-byte blocks would need a bit map of over 332 KB to track its free blocks and 1-TB disk with 4-KB blocks requires 32 MB to store its bit map. As disk size constantly increases, the size of the bit map file increases. So, we will store bit map file on mass storage, rather than in main memory.</p></div>
