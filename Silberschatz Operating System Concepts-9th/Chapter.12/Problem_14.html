<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> </p> <p>The virtual memory system does not interface with buffer, cache; the contents of the file in the buffer cache must be copied into the page cache. Double-caching, requires caching file-system data twice. It wastes memory and also wastes significant CPU and I/O cycles due to extra data movement within system memory. Inconsistencies between two caches result in corrupt files. Hence double caching benefits are avoided. Another say Solaris used page-caching algorithms that share unused memory with processes. Another version Solaris 7 implemented priority paging that gives priority to process pages over the page cache. Solaris 9 and 10 changed the algorithms to maximize memory use and minimize thrashing. This shows the complexities of performance optimizing and caching.</p></div>
