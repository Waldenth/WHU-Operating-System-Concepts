<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The Term <b>Virtualization</b> has many meanings and all aspects of computation are covered in virtualization. <b>Virtual Machine</b> is one such method of achieving virtualization. There are three different ways to implement virtual machines.</p> <p>1. Add Virtual machine support to the kernel</p> <p>2. Providing Hardware features by the CPU</p> <p>3. Supporting virtual machine implementation using I/O Devices </p> <p>Generally with virtualization guest operating system and applications run in an environment that appears to them as native hardware. Thus virtualization creates abstract hardware of single computer and thus creating an illusion that each of the environments is running using its own dedicated hardware. </p> <p>There are several benefits of virtualization; most of them are somehow relevant to the ability to share the same hardware yet run different operating system.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Benefits of virtualization</b> </p> <p>The benefits of virtualization can be detailed as below</p> <p>1. The biggest advantage of virtualization is that the host system is isolated from virtual machines and virtual machines are isolated from each other. This means that a virus in the guest virtual machine can affect or damage its operating system but not the host or any other virtual machine. </p> <p>As a whole, there is insulation between either two virtual machines and that is why they are safe from each other in terms of work. </p> <p>2. Another advantage of virtualization is that a developerâ€™s workstation can concurrently run multiple operating systems. Such virtual machine facilitates fast porting and testing of the programs across different operating system. </p> <p>Moreover, multiple versions of program can run on the same system under different isolated environment. Other than that QA engineers can create their test environment on the same system, where the developers system has been installed and can test their applications.</p> <p>3. A dazzling advantage of virtualization is in production data center. These centers make use of system consolidation, which include running two or more autonomous systems in virtual machines on the same system. This is a kind of recourse optimization since there is a physical to virtual conversion.</p> <p>4. Cloud computing is possible due to virtualization. In this case CPU, memory and I/O is provided as service to the customers via internet. By using APIs a program can create thousands of virtual machines , all running a specific guest operating system and application , which others can access via internet.</p></div>
