<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Virtualization</b> means creating abstract hardware of a single computer and allowing multiple OS to run in separate environment. <b>Virtual Machine</b> is one such method of achieving virtualization. </p> <p>There are different ways to implement virtual machine. Most traditional techniques are Type 0, 1 and 2 hypervisors. </p> <p>Apart from these, there are few other virtualization techniques that provide virtualization like execution environment but are not virtualization techniques indeed. They are para-virtualization, programming environment virtualization, Emulators, and application containment. </p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>These techniques are used to provide the virtualization like environment, but do not actually implement virtualization in true sense. They are described in details below:</p> <p>1. <b>Para-virtualization</b> is a technique in which the guest operating system is modified to work in sync or cooperation with the VMM.</p> <p>• Here, instead of tricking the guest OS into thinking that it has the system to itself, the para-virtualization offers a system identical to the guest OS. The guest must be modified to run on a para-virtualized system. </p> <p>• In such systems the resource utilization is very efficient. For the I/O devices the VMM and guest use shared memory buffer, where the read and write data are placed. The memory management in this technique is done using hypercall. </p> <p>• Each guest has its own set of page tables and hypercall is sent from guest OS to VMM whenever the host page table requires update. This is not true virtualization because the guest OS. </p> <p>2. <b>Programming environment virtualization </b>refers to the technique in which the VMMs do not virtualize or abstract the real hardware but instead they create an optimized virtual system.</p> <p>Example: - Oracle Java, Microsoft .Net</p> <p>• In this method, the programming environment is virtualized not the hardware. Here the programming language is designed to run within a custom built virtualized environment. </p> <p>• Virtual environment can be defined as based on APIs, that provide set of features that we want to have available for particular language and programs written in that language.</p> <p>• The above means that Java programs are written and compiled on Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and then JVM is compiled to be a host program. Thus once a java code is written and compiled on JVM, it can run on any machine which has a JVM available on it. </p> <p>3. <b>Emulators </b>allow applications written in one hardware environment to run on a totally different environment or another CPU.</p> <p> Virtualization means running applications designed for one operating system to run on different operating system, but on the same CPU.</p> <p>• If an application needs to run on a different CPU, then it becomes necessary to translate all source CPU’s instructions and convert them into equivalent instructions of target CPU. This type of environment is called <b>Emulated environment</b>.<b> </b></p> <p>• Emulation is very useful when the host system has different architecture than the guest in terms of hardware and software. So if a company’s old hardware is replaced by a new one the old programs can still be used using an emulator. This increases the life of program.<b> </b></p> <p>Creating an emulator is a challenging deal, because it involves writing an entire CPU in software that can read, parse and simulate all instructions from old system.</p> <p>4. <b>Application Containment </b>provides virtualization like features by segregating applications from the operating system. Thus they contain applications, making them more secure and manageable.</p> <p> Example: - Oracle Solaris Zones, BSD Jails, IBM AIX WPARs</p> <p>• If the applications are all compiled for the same operating system, then a full virtualization is not needed. In such cases one only needs to provide a means or method for various tasks in system. </p> <p>• These might be to segregate applications, manage their resource use, application performance and create an easy way to start, stop and manage processes. This is exactly what is done using Application containment.</p> <p>• In application containment, there are several <b>containers </b>or<b> zones</b> that create a virtual layer between operating system and applications. In this technique, the hardware is not virtualized. </p> <p>Also there is only one kernel installed. But operating system and devices are virtualized. Thus processes within a zone have an impression of being the only process on the system.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>As a recapitulation it can be said that the above defined techniques do not conform to all the requirements that are needed to make them true virtualization environments. They simulate the virtualization very closely though. That is why they are not virtualization techniques indeed.</p></div>
