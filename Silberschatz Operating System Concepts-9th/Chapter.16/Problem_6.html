<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>If a guest operating system is running on one system and it needs to be migrated from one system to another. If this migration is done without shutting down the process, it is called </p> <p> <b>Live Migration</b>. </p> <p>This kind of live migration is very easily implemented in VMMs as against to general purpose operating system. Firstly a copy of the running guest is made on another system running the same VMM.</p> <p>This copy occurs with very little noticeable interruption. </p> <p>So the logged in users has very little impact. Also the network connections to the guest have least impact.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Problems with Systems without virtualization</b> </p> <p>Following might be the problems which the user would face with the systems without virtualization:</p> <p>1. In a general purpose operating system, where virtualization is not implemented, it is impossible to switch. This switching requires warning the users, shutting down the running processes. This also requires moving the binaries and then restarting of processes on new system.</p> <p>So, with live migration, load of an overloaded system is decreased live and without any disruption. This is not possible without virtualization.</p> <p>2. Another thing happens in cases of hardware changes, firmware upgrade, hardware addition, hardware removal or even hardware repair. With virtualization, all the guest operating systems can be migrated off. </p> <p>The work can be done and then systems can be migrated back to system. This would not make any major impact on user or remote connections. </p> <p>This task would be a tough deal with the systems that do not implement virtualization. </p> <p>Thus it can be seen that live migration is possible in systems that have virtualization implemented. That is possible because such systems have well defined interfaces between guests and VMMs.</p></div>
