<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Virtualization</b> means creating abstract hardware of a single computer and allowing multiple OS to run in separate environment. <b>Virtual Machine</b> is one such method of achieving virtualization. </p> <p>Virtual machine implementation involves several components. At the base is <b>the host</b>, underlying hardware system that runs the virtual machines. The <b>Virtual machine manager (VMM)</b> runs virtual machines by providing an interface that is identical to the host. </p> <p>Several VMM software tools like VMware ESX or Citrix XenServer are available which runs virtual machines on the host. VMM is commonly known as <b>Hypervisor</b>.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>There are different ways to implement virtual machines.</p> <p>1. Hardware based support that provides support for virtual machine creation and management. These are generally known as <b>type 0 hypervisors</b></p> <p> Example: - IBM LPRS, Oracle LDOMs generally found on mainframes and such large servers</p> <p>2. Operating system like software built to provide virtualization. These VMMs are called <b>type 1 hypervisors</b></p> <p> Example: - VMware ESX or Citrix XenServer or Joyent SmartOS</p> <p>3. Applications that run on standard operating system but provide VMM features to guest operating system are called <b>type 2 hypervisors</b> </p> <p> Example: - VMware Workstation, Parallels Desktop or Oracle VirtualBox</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Explanation of three types of traditional virtualizatiuon:</p> <p> <b>Type 0 Hypervisors</b> </p> <p>These types of Virtualization are essentially a hardware feature. Operating system don’t need to anything special to use virtualization features. The VMM is loaded in the firmware and loaded at boot time. </p> <p>Some characteristics are as below:</p> <p>1. Hardware is available as partitions or domains and each OS runs in its own partition. For example if a hardware is split into four partitions each with dedicated CPUs , memory and I/O Devices, four virtual systems can be created.</p> <p>2. In case of limited I/O devices, hypervisor manages shared access or grants all devices to control partition. In control partition guest operating system provides services via daemons to other guests. </p> <p>3. Since the type 0 hypervisor can run multiple guest operating system, one in each partition, all the guest operating system can in turn serve as VMMs. This is because each guest OS is itself running on native hardware i.e. partition. This is called virtualization-within-virtualization, which is unique to type 0 hypervisors and not available in any other hypervisors. </p> <p>The same can be depicted in the figure below:</p> <table border="1" style="border-collapse:collapse;"> <tr> <td> <p>Guest</p> </td> <td> <p>Guest</p> </td> <td> <p>Guest</p> </td> <td> <p>Guest</p> </td> <td> <p>Guest</p> </td> <td> <p>I/O Devices</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Guest OS1</p> </td> <td> <p>Guest OS2</p> </td> <td> <p>Guest OS3</p> </td> <td> <p>Guest OS4</p> </td> <td /> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>CPU and Memory</p> </td> <td> <p>CPU and Memory</p> </td> <td> <p>CPU and Memory</p> </td> <td /> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Firmware ( VMM / Hypervisor 0)</p> </td> <td /> </tr> </table> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Type 1 Hypervisors</b> </p> <p>These types of virtual memory managers are commonly used in data centers and are called data center operating systems. Such operating systems run on native hardware but do not provide system calls and other interfaces for the running programs. Instead, they create, run, and manage guest operating system.</p> <p>Some features are as mentioned below:</p> <p>1. Type 1 hypervisors run in kernel mode. They use multiple modes to give guest operating system their own control and improved performance, where ever host CPU allows. </p> <p>2. They implement device drivers for the hardware they run on and also provide OS features like CPU Scheduling, memory management, I/O management, protection and security.</p> <p>3. These are usually closed source and commercially available. Hypervisors 1 have ability to consolidate more operating systems and applications onto fewer systems. </p> <p> In place of using ten systems with 10 % utilization, hypervisor 1 makes it possible to use one system that manages the entire load. </p> <p>4. When the utilization increases guest and applications can be moved to other system live, which is less used. It uses snapshots and cloning to save the states of guests and duplicate those states. </p> <p>This is much easier than taking backups and restoring each guest’s state and installing the same via scripts or tools.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-5</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Type 2 Hypervisors</b> </p> <p>Type 2 hypervisors are application level virtual managers. This type of VMM is simply another process run and managed by the host. The features of this type are as below:</p> <p>1. The host here is unaware of the visualization taking place. They can run on variety of general purpose operating system and running them requires no changes to the host operating system.</p> <p>2. These hypervisors can be used to test non-native operating system without replacing the native operating system. </p> <p>3. While running type 2 hypervisors the user needs administrative privileges to access the hardware assistance features of CPUs.</p> <p>Some examples of tools that provide this kind of virtualization are Oracle VirtualBox and VMWare. </p></div>
