<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>A variable that is used to control multiple processes under parallel programming is often known as a <b>semaphore</b>. </p> <p>Operating system defines two types of semaphores; one is a counting semaphore and another one is binary semaphore. </p> <p>A <b>binary semaphore</b> may only range between 0 and 1 value, and hence its functional operations are similar to that of a mutex lock.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>When it comes to represent the implementation of mutual exclusion with the use of a single binary semaphore, for ‘<i>n</i>’ number of processes, user can execute it as given below:</p> <p>Let the ‘<i>n</i>’ number of processes be described as “<i>Pi</i>”. Now for the mutual exclusion between these <i>n</i> processes we take a semaphore mutex which is initialized to ‘1’. </p> <p>Hence, each <i>Pi</i> process would undergo the below condition:</p> <p>do</p> <p>{</p> <p> wait (mutex);</p> <p> signal (mutex);</p> <p>}</p> <p>while (true);</p> <p>In this piece of code we can see a “do-while” condition. Here, the wait() function lies under critical section of mutual exclusion; whereas signal() function lies under the remainder section of same. </p></div>
