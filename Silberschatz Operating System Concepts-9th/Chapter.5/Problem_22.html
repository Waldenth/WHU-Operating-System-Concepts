<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Benefits of slim- reader and writer (SRW) locks:</b> </p> <p>1.SRM locks activate the threads of single process to access a shared resource.SRM locks provide two modes exclusively for reading and writing the data .</p> <p>2.Shared Mode which grants shared data read only to multiple threads and multiple threads can access the shared data concurrecntly.so,the performance can be increased.</p> <p>3.Exclusive Mode, when a lock is acquired by a thread in write mode,then the lock will not be release until the total operation will complete.And no thread will access the same lock Until the writer releases the lock.</p> <p>4.Once a SRM acquires a lock in shared mode then the there is no possibility to upgrade to exclusive lock state and similarly a lock acquired in exclusive mode donot down grade to shared mode.</p> <p>5.SRM is light weigth and small i.e the size of the pointer (32 or 64 bits) and there are no associated kernel objects for waiting so that it requires minimal resources.</p></div>
