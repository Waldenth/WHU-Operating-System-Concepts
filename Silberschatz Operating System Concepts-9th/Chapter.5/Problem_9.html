<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The three requirements for the critical-section problem are as follows:</p> <p>• Mutual exclusion</p> <p>• Progress requirement</p> <p>• Bounded-waiting</p> <p>The algorithm satisfies the three requirements/conditions for the critical-section problem.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Mutual exclusion:</b> </p> <p>• A process enters into the critical section only when flag variable of any other process is not set to in_cs. </p> <p>• The process sets its flag to in_cs before entering the critical section.</p> <p>• Then the process checks if there is any other process whose flag variable is in_cs.</p> <p>• Thus, it can be ensured that no two processes will be in the critical section.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Progress requirement:</b> </p> <p>• Assume that more than one processes set their flag variable to in_cs at same time.</p> <p>• After each sets its flag, they check if there is any other process whose flag variable is in_cs.</p> <p>• As each realize that there is another competing processes whose flag variable is in_cs, each process move to the next iteration of the while() loop.</p> <p>• Then they set their flag variable to in_want.</p> <p>• Among all the processes, the process whose index value is near to turn variable will set its flag variable to in_cs.</p> <p>• At each iteration, the index of the processes who set their flag variable to in_cs move closer to turn.</p> <p>• Thus, it is ensured that only one process can sets its flag variable to in_cs.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Bounded-waiting:</b> </p> <p>• Suppose a process k wants to enter the critical section. Then its flag variable to in_cs.</p> <p>• If the index of any process that wants to enter the critical section is not in between turn and k, then it cannot enter the critical section.</p> <p>• If the index of any process is between turn and k, then they can enter the critical section and the turn value will come closer to k.</p> <p>• So, turn will become k at some point and can enter the critical section.</p> <p>• Thus, the condition of bounded-waiting is satisfied.</p></div>
