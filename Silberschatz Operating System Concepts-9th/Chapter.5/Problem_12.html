<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>A lock that makes threads of a process enter into wait condition, while searching for availability of desired lock is known as a <b>spinlock</b>. </p> <p>Process cannot hold a spinlock while attempting to acquire a semaphore because of the following reasons: </p> <p>• Semaphores are sleeping lock in Linux. If a task wants to retrieve the semaphore which is already held then the task should be put on the waiting queue to sleep. </p> <p>• Spinlocks are just another form of interrupt disabler and hence they cannot go into a sleeping state. </p> <p>• As the wait duration is usually very small, no thread goes into sleep mode. Rather the threads remain active but still do not perform any useful work. </p> <p>• As the wait time is very small, no process can sleep while holding a spinlock. The process will keep attempting until it get the lock. </p> <p>• Trying to acquire a semaphore variable may take longer time than the wait duration of a spinlock. Hence, one cannot use a semaphore while being in a spinlock condition.</p> <p>• Sleeping while holding spinlocks may force rest of the threads in the process to enter infinite loops until and unless the thread becomes active again.</p></div>
