<div class="answer"> <p>Busy waiting wastes CPU cycles that some other process might be able to use productively. This type of semaphore is called spin lock because the process “spins” while waiting for the lock. When locks are expected to be held for short times, spin locks are useful, they are employed on multiprocessor system where one thread can “spin” on one process while another thread performs its critical section on another processor.</p></div>
