<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Race condition:</b> </p> <p>The condition occurs inside critical section, critical section means when multiple threads access a shared variable at the same time.</p> <p> <b>Kernel Data Structure:</b> </p> <p>• Scheduling queue</p> <p>• Kernel process table</p> <p>• Process id management system (pidms)</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Scheduling Queue:</b> </p> <p>The scheduling queues in the kernel data structure, receive the process. One process in queue has been waiting for the I/O resources, and the resource is free now. The resource is allocated to the process. Second process waiting for the same I/O resource is still pending in the queue. These two processes in the queue are in a race with each other for the allocation of the I/O resources to move to the runnable queue for execution. Hence processes create a race condition in the runnable queue.</p> <p> <b>Kernel Process Table:</b> </p> <p>The kernel table also triggers a race for two processes created at the same time for allocation of space in the kernel table.</p> <p> <b>Process id management system: </b>The pidms permits two processes to be created at the same time, accessing same resources, triggering a race between the two for getting the unique process id (pid).</p></div>
