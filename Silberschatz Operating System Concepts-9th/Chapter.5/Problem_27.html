<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The explanation for the given statement is as follows:</p> <p>• The answer to the bounded buffer question provided above copies the value obtained in the monitors’ local buffer and replicates it from the monitors’ local buffer to the consumer. </p> <p>• The copy tasks can be costly if one were consuming huge amount of memory on behalf of every buffer. </p> <p>• The augmented outlay of copy process signifies that the monitor is occupied for a elongated time interval while a process is in the produce or consumes task. </p> <p>• This lessens the systems total output. </p> <p>• The above setback can be relieved by storing pointers to buffer regions within the monitor as opposed to storing the buffer regions themselves. </p> <p>• Therefore, one can revise the code provided to replicate the pointer to the buffer region in and out of the monitors’ state. </p> <p>• The above task must be comparatively cheap and so the time interval that the monitor is being occupied is shorter, thereby improving the output of the monitor.</p> </div>
