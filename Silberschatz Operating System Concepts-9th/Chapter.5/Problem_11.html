<div class="answer"> <p>Disabling interrupts on every processor can be a difficult task and further more can seriously diminish performance. Disabling interrupts on a multiprocessor can be time consuming, as the message is passed to all the processors. This message passing delays entry into each critical section and system efficiency decreases. Also, consider the effect on a systemâ€™s clock, if the clock is kept updated by interrupts.</p></div>
