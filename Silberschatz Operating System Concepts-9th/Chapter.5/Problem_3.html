<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Processes waiting to enter the critical section use the CPU to keep checking if they can enter their critical section. The act of using the CPU to repeatedly check for entry to the critical section is called <i>busy waiting.</i></p> <p> Busy waiting can be overcome by a wait ( ) and signal ( ) semaphore operation. When a process executes the wait ( ) operation and find that the semaphore value is not positive, it must wait. However, rather than engaging in busy waiting, process can block itself.</p> <p> </p> <p>To avoid busy waiting, weâ€™ll create resources that enforce mutual exclusion and make them accessible by through the operating system. Processes waiting to enter a critical section will be put in the blocked state, just like they were waiting for I/O, so that other processes can continue doing useful work.</p></div>
