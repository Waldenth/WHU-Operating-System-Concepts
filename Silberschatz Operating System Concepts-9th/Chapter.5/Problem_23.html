<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>wait(): </b> </p> <p>The wait() system call used to wait for another process to complete its execution in the operating system and it may wait until any of its child processes to exit in the operating system. </p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>signal():</b> </p> <p>It is a system call or a software interrupt generated by the operating system and sent to the process with some number. That number is called signal ID or signum. The signal is generated when the process is aborted, quit, trace, or hang while the process is executing. </p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>test_and_set():</b> </p> <p>test_and_set() function performs two operations individually and cannot be interrupted in the middle of the process execution. This function used for handling the synchronization problem of two processes. It takes a shared lock variable as an input parameter which is either 0 (unlock) or 1(lock). </p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
