<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>A semaphore S is an integer value indicates the number of resources available.</p> <p>• The wait () operation decreases the value of semaphore S<i> until the value of </i>S<i> become 1. When a process wants a resource, then it performs the wait () operation</i><i> </i><i>to increment semaphore </i>S<i> </i><i>value.</i></p> <p>• <i>The signal () operation increases the value of </i>semaphore S<i>. When the process does not need the resource anymore, then it performs the signal () operation to increment semaphore </i>S<i> </i><i>value.</i></p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>A process must do both the operations concurrently to achieve the mutual exclusion.</p> <p>If the operations wait () and signal () do not execute automatically, then mutual exclusion may be violated.</p> <p> <b>The condition where the mutual exclusion may be violated when the wait () and signal () semaphore operation are not executed automatically is shown below:</b> </p> <p>If the number of available resources S is 1, and the two processes P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>2</sub> executes only wait () operation concurrently, then the mutual exclusion may be violated.</p> <p>When P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>2</sub> determine that value of S is 1 and both performs wait () operation, then P<sub>1</sub> decrements S by 1 and enters critical section and P<sub>2</sub> decrements S by 1 and enters the critical section.</p> <p>But, the processes are not performing the signal () operation after the wait () operation. This condition leads to the violation of the mutual exclusion.</p> <p>The timeline of the processes <i>P</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>P</i><sub>2</sub> is as shown below:</p> <p>T<sub>0</sub>: P<sub>1</sub> determines that value of S = 1.</p> <p>T<sub>1</sub>: P<sub>2</sub> determines that value of S = 1.</p> <p>T<sub>2</sub>: P<sub>1</sub> decrements S by 1 and enters the critical section. </p> <p>T<sub>3</sub>: P<sub>2</sub> decrements S by 1 and enters the critical section. </p></div>
