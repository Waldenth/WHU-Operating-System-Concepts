<div class="answer"> <p>Throughput in the readers-writers problem is increased by favoring multiple readers as opposed to allowing a single writer to exclusively access the shared values. On the other hand, favoring readers could result in starvation for writers. </p> <p> The starvation in the readers writers problem could be avoided by keeping timestamps associated with waiting processes. When a writer is finished with its task, it would wake up the process that has been waiting for the longest duration. When a reader arrives and notices that another reader is accessing the database, then it would enter the critical section only if there are no waiting writers. These restrictions would guarantee fairness.</p></div>
