<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>A monitor helps in achieving process synchronization. It allows threads to have both, mutual exclusion and the ability to wait for a certain condition to be true.</p> <p>Consider a system with <i>n</i>-processes, having unique priority number. The goal is to write a monitor to allocate these processes to three identical printers:</p> <p>• An array for the three printers in created.</p> <p>• A procedure, <i>acquire()</i>, is created to check and allocate processes to the printer, using the priority numbers of the processes.</p> <p>• Check if the printers are busy.</p> <p>• If true, the process is suspended until one of the printer is free.</p> <p>• Each process is assigned to one of the printers, by their priority number.</p> <p>• Create a procedure, <i>release()</i>, to resume a process associated with the priority number.</p> <p>• If a printer is free, the process is resumed and allocated to that printer.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The implementation of the monitor is shown using the pseudocode:</p> <p>type resource = monitor var P: array[0..2] of boolean; X: condition; procedure acquire (id: integer, printer-id: integer);     begin         if P[0] and P[1] and P[2] then X.wait(id)         if not P[0] then printer-id := 0;                 else if not P[1] then printer-id := 1;                         else printer-id := 2;         P[printer-id]:=true;     end </p> <p>procedure release (printer-id: integer)    begin         P[printer-id]:=false;         X.signal;     end </p> <p>    begin         P[0] := P[1] := P[2] := false; end </p></div>
