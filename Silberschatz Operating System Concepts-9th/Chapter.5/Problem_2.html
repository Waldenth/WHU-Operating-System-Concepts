<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Multiple Locking Mechanisms</b> </p> <p>Solaris, Linux and Windows XP all three operating systems implements multiple locking mechanism to protect the access of critical section code. </p> <p>Consider a case given below:</p> <p>• Processes perform many operations like read, write, update on the critical section. If OS doesn’t use any locking mechanism, every process uses the critical section and change the code it will results inconsistency. </p> <p>To avoid inconsistency, the above mentioned operating systems have multiple locking mechanisms. The multiple locking mechanisms implementation is shown below:</p> <p>• A process p1 acquires a lock to critical section for its execution.</p> <p>• At the same time, a process p2 wants to use the critical section but, it will be locked by some other process.</p> <p>• P2 must wait until the lock releases by p1. Here, no chance to occurrence of inconsistency.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Windows:</b> </p> <p>• Windows uses <i>mutex lock</i>, when the number of threads waits in a queue. Thread acquires mutex lock on a nonsignaled dispatcher and releases the lock on a signed dispatcher.</p> <p>• Critical-section uses <i>spin lock</i> when a thread waits for another thread to release the lock.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Linux:</b> </p> <p>• Linux uses <i>mutex_lock ()</i> and <i>mutex_unlock ()</i> function to acquire and release the locks.</p> <p>• Linux uses <i>Spin locks</i> only for short duration processes. </p> <p>• When a process requires a lock for long duration, it must use <i>semaphores</i>.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Solaris:</b> </p> <p>• Solaris uses <i>adaptive mutex lock</i> to protect the access of each data item in the critical section. If a data is locked, adaptive mutex lock follows two things:</p> <p>o If lock is held by a thread currently running on the CPU, the thread spins until the lock becomes available.</p> <p>o If the thread holding the lock is not in the running state, thread sleeps until the release of lock.</p> <p>• Solaris uses <i>mutex lock</i> when a thread contains less than 500 instructions.</p> <p>• Solaries uses <i>condition variables</i> and <i>semaphores</i> for longer code segments.</p></div>
