<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Algorithm comparison</b> </p> <p>The algorithms are ranked in the table below based on their page-fault rates:</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/4f5/4f595796-06fa-4fd2-864b-dba87cea04b2/5644-9-4PE-i1.png" alt="5644-9-4PE-1" /> </p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>a) The LRU associates a time with each page in the memory and the ones with the greatest value are replaced. It does not suffer from Belady’s anomaly.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>b) The FIFO replacement algorithm replaces the page which was first brought into the memory followed by the next and so on. This algorithm suffers from Belady’s anomaly.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>c) An optimal algorithm would never suffer from Belady’s anomaly according to its definition. It would replace a page which is not in use for the longest time.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-5</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>d) The second-chance works on the FIFO algorithm and uses a reference bit. This algorithm suffers from Belady’s anomaly as the FIFO algorithm.</p></div>
