<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The following pagefaults take place: page fault to access the instruction, a page fault to access the memory location that contains a pointer to the target memory location, and a page fault when the target memory location is accessed.The operating system will generate three page faults with the third page replacing the page containing the instruction. If the instruction needs to be fetched again to repeat the trapped instruction,then the sequence of page faults will continue indefinitely. If the instruction is cached in a register,then it will be able to execute completely after the third page fault.</p></div>
