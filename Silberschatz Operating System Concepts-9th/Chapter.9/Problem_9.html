<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Simulating reference bit:</b> </p> <p>The reference bit is required by the paging algorithm in the operating system, but the hardware component in the system does not provide the reference bit.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>• But, the reference bit can be generated using valid and invalid bit in the hardware component.</p> <p>• At first, simulation in the operating system is done using a reference. Now, the software bit in the operating is assigned to 1.</p> <p>• The valid and invalid bit in the hardware component is assigned as valid.</p></div>
