<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Refer Figure 9.32 given in exercise of text book.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>a.</b> </p> <p> <b>Virtual Address :</b> A <A href="http://searchcio-midmarket.techtarget.com/definition/binary">binary</A> number in <A href="http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/virtual-memory">virtual memory</A> which enables a process to use a location in main memory separately from other processes and use more space than actual in primary memory is called virtual address.</p> <p> <b>Physical Address:</b> In main memory, physical address is represented differently from the virtual address. It is a <A href="http://searchcio-midmarket.techtarget.com/definition/binary">binary</A> number in the form of logical high and low states on an <A href="http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/address">address </A><A href="http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/bus">bus</A> that corresponds to a particular cell of main memory. </p> <table border="1" style="border-collapse:collapse;"> <tr> <td> <p>0xE12C</p> </td> <td> <p>0x312C</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>0x3A9D</p> </td> <td> <p>0xAA9D </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>0xA9D9</p> </td> <td> <p>0x59D9</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>0x7001</p> </td> <td> <p>0xF001</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>0xACA1</p> </td> <td> <p>0x5CA1</p> </td> </tr> </table> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>b. </b> </p> <p>The only options of pages are 4, 8, 12, and 13. Thus, example addresses include anything that begins with the hexadecimal sequence 0x4..., 0x8..., 0xC..., and 0xD.... </p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>c. </b> </p> <p>• <b>LRU page replacement algorithm:</b> The algorithm that calculates which page have been used maximum and will be use so frequently. It throws out the page which is not in use since very long and remains will be unused too. </p> <p>• The full form of LRU is least recently used. It works like its name.</p> <p> <b>Any page table entries that have a reference bit of zero. This includes the following frames {9, 1, 14, 13, 8, 0, 4}</b> </p></div>
