<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>a.</b> </p> <p> <b>No. </b>Installing a faster CPU will not improve the utilization of the CPU. As the CPU is attached to the motherboard, the speed and the CPU utilization are depending on the motherboard components.</p> <p> <b>Therefore, installing a faster CPU wouldn’t improv the CPU utilization.</b> </p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>b.</b> </p> <p> <b>No. </b>If a bigger paging disk is installed in the system, it can store a greater number of pages in the secondary storage disk. This will increase the paging disk utilization. Therefore, CPU swaps the pages from the disk to a memory greater number of times.</p> <p> <b>Therefore, installing a bigger paging disk wouldn’t improve the CPU utilization.</b> </p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>c.</b> </p> <p> <b>No</b>. The Degree of multiprogramming allows the maximum number of processes that can be executed in a single processor system. As the number of processes share the same amount of memory in multiprogramming, it will not show any improvement of CPU utilization.</p> <p> <b>Therefore, Increase the degree of multiprogramming wouldn’t improve the CPU utilization.</b> </p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>d.</b> </p> <p> <b>Yes</b>. All the processes running in the multiprogramming environment share the common memory. If the degree of multiprogramming is decreased, then no process will be waiting for the memory and the process which is currently being executed is using the memory. It will not wait for the memory.</p> <p> <b>Therefore, decreasing the degree of multiprogramming will improves the CPU utilization</b>.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-5</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>e.</b> </p> <p> <b>Yes</b>. Installing more main memory will definitely increase the CPU utilization. The main memory stores all the programs which are requested by the CPU for its execution. As the size of the main memory is large, it will not depend on the secondary disk and no need of swap outs. So that, the CPU can execute the programs by directly accessing memory.</p> <p> <b>Therefore, installing more main memory will likely to be improves the CPU utilization.</b> </p> </div>
<h2>Step-6</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>f.</b> </p> <p> <b>Yes</b>. The CPU will access the disk whenever the requested page is not available in the main memory. If a faster hard disk or multiple hard disks with multiple controllers are installed, then the CPU can access a greater number of pages from the disk. This will result a removal of bottleneck and increasing throughput to the disks.</p> <p>The CPU can access the data quickly and executes a greater number of programs. <b>Therefore, installing faster hard disk or multiple hard disks will improve the CPU utilization.</b></p> </div>
<h2>Step-7</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>g.</b> </p> <p> <b>Yes</b>. A prepaging scheme is added to the page-fetch algorithms, it will bring the pages into the memory before as they are requested by the CPU. Therefore, the CPU will not wait for the data and get it quickly. <b>Therefore, the CPU executes the pages quickly and improves the CPU utilization.</b></p> <p>It will raise a problem, when the page is brought into the memory which is not needed by the CPU. Then, the prepaging scheme will not get benefited to improve the utilization of the CPU. </p> </div>
<h2>Step-8</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>h.</b> </p> <p> <b>No</b>. Increasing page size will result an increasing number of page faults when the data are being accesses sequentially. If the data is being accessed randomly, then the paging action needed by the CPU is more because, fewer pages are kept in the memory and the remaining pages are stored on disk. This will cause more data needed to be transferred per every page fault. </p> <p> <b>Therefore, increasing the page size wouldn’t improve the CPU utilization.</b> </p></div>
