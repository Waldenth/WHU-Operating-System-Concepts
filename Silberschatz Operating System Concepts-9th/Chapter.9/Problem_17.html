When a write does indeed take place, then a copy must be made to allow the two programs to individually access the different copies without interfering with each other. Copy-on-write is a common technique used by several Operating Systems like windows XP, Linux and Solaris. </p> <p> The hardware support required to implement copy-on-write is simply a write protection bit in the page table and TLB entries, which will force a trap to the operating system if a process attempts to write a page with the write protection bit already set.<i> </i></p> <p>Copy-on-write is illustrated in figure 9.7 and figure 9.8.</p></div>
