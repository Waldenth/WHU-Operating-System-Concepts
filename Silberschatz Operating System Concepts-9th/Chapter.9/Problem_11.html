If the relocation is not possible and there is no segment is large enough to fit the incoming segment then we will swap out the segment which came first to make room for the new segment. If relocation is possible then we will rearrange the segments to make a space to accommodate new segment. </p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> </p> <p> <b>Segment-replacement algorithm based on</b> <b>LRU</b>:</p> <p> In this algorithm, we will search for the segment that has not been used for the longest period of time and that is large enough to fit the incoming segment. If relocation is not possible and no segment is large enough, then we will swap out next segment which has not been used for longest period to make a space for the new segment. If relocation is possible, then rearrange the oldest segments to be contiguous in memory and replace those with the new segment.</p></div>
