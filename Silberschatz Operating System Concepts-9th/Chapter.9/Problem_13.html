<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Page tables</b> </p> <p>A page table is used to mark the entries stored in it using a valid/invalid bit. The base and limit registers signify the starting and ending address to be used in memory for a program.</p> <p>If the size of the segments in memory is fixed, the base and limit registers can be simulated using a page table. This can be achieved by entering the contents of the base register into the page table and then the valid/invalid bit can be used to mark the segment which is currently in the memory. In this manner, the page table can be used to simulate base and limit registers.</p></div>
