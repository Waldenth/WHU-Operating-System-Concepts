<div class="answer"> <p>Loading the entire program into memory results in loading the executable code for all options, regardless of whether an option is ultimately selected by the user or not. Initially loading pages are needed. This is known as demand paging. </p> <p>With this scheme we need some form of hardware support to distinguish between the pages that are in memory and the pages that are on the disk.The valid –invalid bit scheme described can be used for this purpose.This time ,however,when this bit is set to “valid”,the associated page is both legal and in memory.If the bit is set to “invalid”,the page either is not valid but is currently on the disk.The page-table entry for a page that is brought into memory is set as usual,but the page-table entry for a page that is not currently in memory is either simply marked invalid or contains the address of the page on disk.</p> <p>The hardware supports are:</p> <p>Secondary memory usually disk, pager and swapper.</p> <p>Figure 9.5</p></div>
