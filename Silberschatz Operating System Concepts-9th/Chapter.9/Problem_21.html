<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>LRU: (Least Recently Used)</b> </p> <p>In LRU page replacement algorithm replaces the page which remains unused for a long duration.</p> <p>Consider the page reference string and paging with three frames:</p> <p>7, 2, 3, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6, 7, 7, 1, 0, 5, 4, 6, 2, 3, 0, 1</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/media/cbb/cbb15ca8-176b-4c0a-92e4-ff7d1c9db813/13258-9-21E-i1.png" alt="C:\Users\kaifi\Desktop\CDR Tif\2.png" /> </p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Explanation:</b> </p> <p>• First insert page 7,2,3 are inserted in the three frames, then count the number of page faults is 3.</p> <p>• Second, 1 is inserted at Least recently used page which is 7, then replace the 7 with 1. It is considered as a 1-page fault</p> <p>• 2 is already in the frames. So, it is not inserted into the frame. Thus, It is not considered as a page fault.</p> <p>• Next, insert 5,3,4,6,7 is inserted into the frames, then count the number of page faults is 4.</p> <p>• Likewise, the procedure is going on until the last page 1 is inserted into the page.</p> <p>• Finally, count the number of page faults is 18.</p> <p> </p> <p>The above paging diagram illustrates <b>LRU page replacement</b> for the above string. In the diagram, user represented which pages are in the three frames, each time a page fault occurs. Count all the number of page faults are eighteen.</p> <p> Thus, number of faults for the above page reference string using LRU replacement algorithm is <b>18.</b></p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>FIFO: (First in First Out)</b> </p> <p>The name speaks it all; this page replacement method replaces pages as they occur. The oldest one is replaced first and the method goes on.</p> <p>Consider the page reference string and paging with three frames:</p> <p>7, 2, 3, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6, 7, 7, 1, 0, 5, 4, 6, 2, 3, 0, 1</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/media/4e0/4e072bcc-e42d-4621-bfd8-7bed706d8c74/13258-9-21E-i2.png" alt="2" /> </p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Explanation:</b> </p> <p>• First insert page 7,2,3 are inserted in the three frames, then count the number of page faults is 3.</p> <p>• Second, 1 is inserted at Least recently used page which is 7, then replace the 7 with 1. It is considered as a 1-page fault</p> <p>• 2 is already in the frames. So, it is not inserted into the frame. Thus, it is not considered as a page fault.</p> <p>• Next, 5 is inserted into the frame, then count the number of page faults is 1.</p> <p>• To insert 3 in FIFO bases it is already in the frame, so it is not considered as page fault.</p> <p>• Likewise, the procedure is going on until the last page 1 is inserted into the page.</p> <p>• Finally, count the number of page faults is 17.</p> <p>The diagram illustrates <b>FIFO page replacement</b> for the above string. In the diagram, user represented which pages are in the three frames, each time a fault occurs. In all number of faults are seventeen.</p> <p> </p> <p>Thus, number of faults for the above page reference string using FIFO replacement algorithm is <b>17.</b></p> </div>
<h2>Step-5</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Optimal Page Replacement:</b> </p> <p>In Optimal page replacement algorithm, the system replaces the page that would be idle for longer period in future.</p> <p>Consider the page reference string and paging with three frames:</p> <p>7, 2, 3, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6, 7, 7, 1, 0, 5, 4, 6, 2, 3, 0, 1</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/media/0d8/0d88dabb-d785-4ecd-9fa5-ab37ff302a4d/13258-9-21E-i3.png" alt="C:\Users\kaifi\Desktop\CDR Tif\3.png" /> </p> <p> <b> </div>
<h2>Step-6</h2>
<div class="answer">Explanation:</b> </p> <p>• First insert page 7,2,3 are inserted in the three frames, then count the number of page faults is 3.</p> <p>• Second, 1 is inserted at Least recently used page which is 7, then replace the 7 with 1. It is considered as a 1-page fault.</p> <p>• 2 is already in the frames. So, it is not inserted into the frame. Thus, it is not considered as a page fault.</p> <p>• Next, insert 5 is inserted into the frame, then count the number of page faults is 1.</p> <p>• To insert 3 in Optimal replacement bases, so it is not considered as a page fault.</p> <p>• Likewise, the procedure is going on until the last page 1 is inserted into the page.</p> <p>• Finally, count the number of page faults is 17.</p> <p>The diagram illustrates <b>Optimal Page Replacement</b> for the above string. In the diagram, user represented which pages are in the three frames, each time a fault occurs. In all number of faults are thirteen.</p> <p>Thus, number of faults for the above page reference string using optimal Replacement algorithm is <b>13.</b></p></div>
