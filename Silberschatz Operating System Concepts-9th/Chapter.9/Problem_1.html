<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"><p>2481-9-12E SA: 8683</p> <p> SR: 4478</p> <p>________________________________________________________________________</p> <p>A <b>page fault</b> occurs when a process addresses a page whose valid/invalid bit is set to invalid.  It also can be stated that this happens when a process addresses a point in logical memory that is not currently in physical memory.</p> <p>When the page fault occurs, the operating system traps, suspending the process.  It checks to see if the reference itself is legal (the reference is to a page not currently in memory) or illegal (the reference is to a page that doesn't actually exist).  </p> <p>If the reference was illegal, then the process is aborted.  If the reference was legal, the operating system prepares to bring the needed frame into physical memory.  If there is a frame available from the free frame list, then the page is simply loaded.  If there is not a free frame available, the operating system selects a current frame as a victim (using a page replacement algorithm), may write this frame back to secondary storage, and loads the needed page into the newly available frame.  Finally, the page table is updated to reflect this modification, and the process's execution is restarted from the line which caused the trap.</p></div>
