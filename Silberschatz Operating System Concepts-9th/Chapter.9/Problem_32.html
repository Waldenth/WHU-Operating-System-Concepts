<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Thrashing is a situation in which paging activity is very high. If a process is thrashing, then it spends its more time in paging than in execution.</p> <p> <b>Cause of thrashing:</b> </p> <p>• A process that does not have enough frames to run, quickly page-faults again and again. That is the process spending it’s all time in paging. As a result, CPU utilization will be decreased.</p> <p>• CPU scheduler, on seeing low CPU utilization, will increase the degree of multiprogramming, while all processes spending their time in paging.</p> <p> <b>Therefore, high paging operations (swap-in and swap-out) taking place, due to lack available frames and increasing degree of multiprogramming while all the processes spending all their time in paging causes thrashing.</b> </p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Detection of thrashing:</b> </p> <p>• Thrashing occurs when increasing degree of multiprogramming while all the processes spending all their time in paging. </p> <p>• To increase degree of multiprogramming CPU scheduler will add new process to queue. The new process also quickly causes more page faults, as there are no free frames. Again, the new process also spends its time in paging and CPU utilization will be decreased further. </p> <p>• Again, CPU scheduler adds new process to increase the degree of multiprogramming.</p> <p>• In Thrashing, CPU utilization will be decreased rapidly, as increasing degree of multiprogramming.</p> <p> <b>Therefore, system can detect thrashing by observing rapid decrease in CPU utilization, as the degree of multiprogramming is increasing.</b> </p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Eliminating thrashing:</b> </p> <p>• Thrashing is caused by increasing degree of multiprogramming while processes are spending their time in paging. </p> <p>• Thus, system decreases degree of multiprogramming, to eliminate thrashing. System can stop adding new processes to queue or do not allow a process that causes thrashing to steal frames from another process, to decrease the degree of multiprogramming. </p> <p> <b>Therefore, to remove thrashing, system can decrease the degree of multiprogramming immediately</b> <b>. </b> </p></div>
