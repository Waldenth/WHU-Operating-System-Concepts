<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>a. When a page fault occurs and if the page does not exist in the free frame pool, then one of the pages in the free frame pool needs to be evicted to the disk, creating space for one of the resident pages to be moved to the free frame pool. The accessed page is then moved to the resident set. </p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>b. If the page exists in the free-frame pool, then it is moved into the set of resident pages, while one of the resident pages is moved to the free-frame pool. </p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>c. The system degenerates into the page replacement algorithm used in the free frame pool, namely an LRU managed system. </p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>d. The system degenerates into a FIFO-managed system. </p></div>
