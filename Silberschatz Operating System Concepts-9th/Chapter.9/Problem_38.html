<div class="answer"> <p>The program may have a large code segment or user large-sized arrays of data. These portions of the program could be allocated to larger pages, thereby decreasing the memory overheads associated with a page table. The virtual memory system would then have to maintain multiple free lists of pages for the different sizes and should also need to have more complex code for address translation to take into account different page sizes.</p></div>
