<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Buddy System</b> tree for 6 KB request:</p> <p>• The diagram illustrates how the total memory space is divided into equal partitions at each level. The partition divided is represented into left and right section. </p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/ebb/ebb1dd8c-c192-47ae-91ef-5ab2d5f9aa63/13258-9-35E-i1.png" alt="1" /> </p> <p>• Hence, for a 6 KB space request, user get a tree of 7-levels. Here the 6KB request will be fulfilled by the 8 KB G-L segments.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Buddy System</b> tree for 250 bytes request,</p> <p>250 bytes = 0.25 KB</p> <p>• The diagram illustrates how the total memory space is divided into equal partitions at each level. </p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/3c1/3c1c746f-9e55-4eda-84db-fab180aa994d/13258-9-35E-i2.png" alt="2" /> </p> <p>• The partition divided is represented into left and right section. Hence, for a 250 bytes space request we get a tree of 10-levels. Here the 0.25 KB request will be fulfilled by the 1 KB J-L segments.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Buddy System</b> tree for 900 bytes request,</p> <p>900 bytes = 0.9 KB</p> <p>• The below given tree illustrates how the total memory space is divided into equal partitions at each level. </p> <p>• The partition divided is represented into left and right section. Hence, for a 900 bytes space request we get a tree of 10-levels. Here the 0.9 KB request will be fulfilled by the 1 KB J-L segments.</p> <p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/d37/d37c3f26-a7b2-4228-886b-dcce001d3545/13258-9-35E-i3.png" alt="3" /> </p> </div>
<h2>Step-5</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Buddy System</b> tree for 1500 bytes request,</p> <p>1500 bytes = 1.5 KB</p> <p>• The diagram illustrates how the total memory space is divided into equal partitions at each level. </p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/f9d/f9d74ebf-ce18-4252-bcfd-9b4bea681a4f/13258-9-35E-i4.png" alt="4" /> </p> <p>• The partition divided is represented into left and right section. Hence, for a 1500 bytes space request we get a tree of 9-levels. Here the 1.5 KB request will be fulfilled by the 2 KB I-L segments.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-6</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Buddy System</b> tree for 7 KB request,</p> <p>• Below given tree illustrates how the total memory space is divided into equal partitions at each level. </p> <p>• The partition divided is represented into left and right section. Hence, for a 7 KB space request we get a tree of 7-levels. Here the 7 KB request will be fulfilled by the 8 KB G-L segments.</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/dab/dab86c2d-7940-4759-afcf-792b5cc4d09c/13258-9-35E-i5.png" alt="5" /> </p> <p> <b> </div>
<h2>Step-7</h2>
<div class="answer">After Memory Release</b> </p> <p>After releasing 250 bytes, 900 bytes & 1500 bytes, the segment which will still be occupied is the 8 KB segment. </p> <p>• Whereas, following segments will be free:-</p> <p>512 KB, 256 KB, 128 KB, 64 KB, 32 KB, 16 KB, 4 KB, 2 KB and 1 KB.</p> <p>• The only occupied 8 KB segment is allocated to the 6 KB and 7 KB request.</p></div>
