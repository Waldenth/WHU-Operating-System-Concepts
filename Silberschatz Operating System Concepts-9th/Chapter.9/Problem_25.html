<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>MFU page replacement policy:</b> </p> <p>Most Frequently Used (MFU) page replacement policy will brought the pages in the memory which was used most frequently.</p> <p>• To find the page frame with most frequently used, counting mechanism should be added to the tables.</p> <p>• The counting mechanism is needed to count the page references frequency.</p> <p>• The contents of the page frame with high frequency counter will be swapped in by the MFU.</p> <p> <b>LRU page replacement policy:</b> </p> <p>Least Recently Used (LRU) page replacement policy will remove the pages in the memory which have the least amount of recent activity.</p> <p>• It is considered that these pages will not be used in the near future.</p> <p>• Mostly used pages will remain in the memory for long time.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>MFU generates fewer page faults than LRU:</b> </p> <p>Considering the sequences for a system that can hold four pages in the memory of the system such as “<img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/8e4/8e4954d3-878d-41f1-8b93-c391c25e2af5/13258-9-25E-i1.png" />”. The MFU generates page faults less than LRU page replacement algorithm during the situation in which memory a system holds 4 pages of memory access sequence “<img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/002/0025bea4-fd29-45d6-bf38-283b9559caa6/13258-9-25E-i2.png" />”.</p> <p>• Using the Least Frequently Used (LFU) algorithm the system removes out “page 4” according to MFU algorithm and inserts “page 5” into the system.</p> <p>• The system throws out “page 1” according to LRU algorithm and then inserts “page 5” into the system.</p> <p>According to this situation, MFU page replacement algorithm is better page replacement algorithm than LRU (Least recently Used) page replacement algorithm. But, if the page sequence is changed as “1 2 3 4 4 4 4 4 5 1” then LRU works well and can be considered as better choice than MFU page replacement algorithm.</p></div>
