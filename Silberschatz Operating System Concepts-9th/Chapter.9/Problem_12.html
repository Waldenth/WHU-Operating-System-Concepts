<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>2481-9-5E SA: 8683</p> <p> SR: 4460</p> <p>________________________________________________________________________</p> <p> <b>a) CPU utilization 13 percent; disk utilization 97 percent.</b> </p> <p>• Here CPU utilization is less than disk utilization means system leads to thrashing.</p> <p>• The degree of multiprogramming should be decreased to increase CPU utilization. </p> <p>• Here paging causes underutilization of CPU. So, it is not helping.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>b) CPU utilization 87 percent; disk utilization 3 percent</b>.</p> <p>• Utilization of CPU is very good; CPU is being busy most of the time.</p> <p>• The degree of multiprogramming probably should stay the same, increasing it may lead to thrashing.</p> <p>• Here paging helps to keep the CPU busy most of the time doing useful work. So, paging is helping in this case.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>c) CPU utilization 13 percent; disk utilization 3 percent</b>.</p> <p>• Utilization of CPU is not appreciable; the CPU is not getting enough work.</p> <p>• The degree of multiprogramming should be increased to increase the CPU utilization.</p> <p>• Here, paging is not really helping or hurting.</p></div>
