<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>2481-9-7E SA: 8683</p> <p> SR: 4478</p> <p>________________________________________________________________________</p> <p> <b>a) </b> </p> <p> <b>Yes</b>, a thread changes its state from the <b>Running state to the Blocked state</b> when a</p> <p>page fault occurs because when a page fault occurs, the process starts to wait for I/O operation to finish. The OS does several things while the process is waiting. It checks whether the page is really invalid or just on disk, finds a free memory frame, schedules a disk access to load the page into the frame, updates the page table with the new logical-physical mapping, updates the valid bit of that entry, and eventually restarts the process by change its state from Blocked to Ready.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>b)</b> <b>Not necessarily</b>, because if a page table entry is not found in the TLB (TLB miss), the page number is used to index and process the page table. If the page is already in main memory, then TLB is updated to include the new page entry, while the process execution continues since there is no I/O operation needed. If the page is not in the main memory, a page fault is generated. In this case, the process needs to change to the Blocked state and wait for I/O to access the disk.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>c) No</b> because no I/O operation is needed if the address reference is resolved in the page table, which indicates the page required is loaded in the main memory already.</p></div>
