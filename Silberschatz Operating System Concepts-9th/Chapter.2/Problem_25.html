<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The advantage of layered approach is modularity. This simplifies debugging and system verification. The design and system implementation is simplified. When the system is broken down into layers. A layer does not need to know how these operations are implemented, it know only what these operations do. Hence, each layer hides the existence of data structure, the operations and hardware from higher level layers.</p> <p> The disadvantage of layered approaches defining the various layers in appropriate manner. Planning of layers is necessary because always the lower-level layer is used. Secondly, layered approach is less efficient than other method.</p></div>
