<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Every program executes different sections of code when the interrupts are occurred and spent some time on their execution. The statistical profile of the amount of time required to execute the different sections of code can be obtained by using Periodic timer interrupts.</p> <p> <b>Periodic timer interrupts:</b> </p> <p>This is an interrupt records the value of the program counter for every occurrence of interrupt and record the time spent on the different sections or parts of the program.</p> <p>â€¢ The statistical profile of a program which is active must be consistent with the time spent by the sections of code in the program because the section must return to original program after completing the execution. </p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Importance to obtain the statistical profile:</b> </p> <p>The programmer can determine how much time spent by executing the different sections code, since programmer can optimize the time by optimizing the utilization of resources by obtaining the statistical profile.</p></div>
