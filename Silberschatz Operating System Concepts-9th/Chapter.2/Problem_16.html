<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>System calls: </b> </p> <p>• It provides interface to communicate with the kernel.</p> <p>• It is a software interrupt, which ensure that the user program can obtain system privileged services through some instruction which will be executed by the operating system.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The advantage of using the same interface are as follows:</p> <p>• The same set of system call can be used for device and file because once the device has been requested, we can read write and reposition the device, just as we can with files.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The Disadvantage of using the same interface are as follows:</p> <p>• The potential for device contention and perhaps leads to dead lock.</p></div>
