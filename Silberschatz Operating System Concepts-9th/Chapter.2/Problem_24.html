<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Reason why the Java program which is running on Android system does not use Java API and Virtual machine:</p> <p>• The Java programs running on android systems do not use the standard java API and virtual machine because they are designed for desktop systems and server systems, not for the mobile devices.</p> <p>• Dalvik virtual machine and set of library are included by the android runtime environment. The standard Java API is not used by the java environment but it uses android API and virtual machine for mobile devices for java development. This separate API is developed by Google.</p> <p>• When a java class file is compiled, java byte code is produced which is platform independent and robust. The Dalvik virtual machine is responsible for converting the java byte code into the executable files. </p></div>
