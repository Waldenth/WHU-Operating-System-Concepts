<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Five services provided by the operating system are given as follows:</p> <p>1. Program execution </p> <p>2. I/O operations</p> <p>3. File-system manipulation </p> <p>4. Communications </p> <p>5. Error detection</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Program Execution: </b> </p> <p>• It allows the user to execute programs by providing convenient environment for development and execution of programs.</p> <p>• The operating system handles memory allocation, multitasking etc. </p> <p>• A user level program cannot properly allocate CPU time.</p> <p> <b>I/O Operations: </b> </p> <p>• Every program may require some input/output such as a file or an I/O device. </p> <p>• The operating system provides an environment to handle I/O operations.</p> <p>• A user level program cannot control the I/O devices directly. For some I/O devices, special functions are necessary.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>File-system manipulation:</b> </p> <p>• All tasks related to files such as creating a file, deleting a file, reading a file, writing to a file etc. are handled by the operating system.</p> <p>• A user need not have to know the details of secondary storage system. All a user can see is that his task is accomplished. </p> <p>• User made programs cannot be made to allocate free blocks when available and deallocate the blocks after deletion.</p> <p> <b>Communications:</b> </p> <p>• There are times when a process needs to communicate with other process. All this is taken care by operating system. </p> <p>• Communication takes place in the form of data packets and they needs access to the network device but user level programs cannot provide that.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Error detection:</b> </p> <p>• An operating system constantly monitors the system and checks for errors which can cause malfunctioning to the system. </p> <p>• All the data before writing to the hard disk must be ensured that they are not corrupted and they are not modified when they were written to the media. </p> <p>• All these errors can frequently occur on the system and there must be a global program to handle all such errors.</p> <p>• It is difficult for a user level program to handle detection of errors efficiently.</p></div>
