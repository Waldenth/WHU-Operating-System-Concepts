<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The backing – store driver would normally be above CPU scheduler, because the driver may need to wait for I/O and CPU can be rescheduled during this time. However on large system, the CPU scheduler may have more information about all the active processes than can fit in memory. Therefore, this information may need to be swapped in and out of memory, requiring the backing-store driver routine to be below the CPU schedule.</p> <p> </p> <p> When a user program executes an I/O operation, it executes an I/O operation, it executes a system call that is trapped to the I/O layer, which calls the memory management layer, which in turn calls CPU –scheduling layer, which is then passed to hardware. At each layer parameter may be modified, data may need to be passed and so on. Each layer adds overhead to system call, the net result is a system call that takes longer than does one on a non layered system.</p> <p> The layers are designed, providing most of the advantages of modularized code while avoiding difficult problem of layer definition and interaction</p></div>
