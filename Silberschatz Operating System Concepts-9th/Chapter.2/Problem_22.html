<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Loadable kernel module is defined as the source file which contains code for extending the running kernel. It is also called as base kernel. Loadable kernel modules are generally used for supporting new hardware and file system for adding system calls. Whenever the functionality provided by the loadable kernel module is not required, it can be unloaded for making resources and memory free.</p> <p> <b>Following are the advantages of the loadable kernel module:</b> </p> <p>• Whenever a new functionality is added or a bug is fixed, there is no need of rebuilding the whole kernel. Just compile the new functionalities.</p> <p>• Memory can be saved because the operating system need not include the functionality which is already compiled in the base kernel. </p> <p>• Loadable kernel module is more flexible than the layered system because any module can call any other module.</p> <p>• Loadable kernel module is more efficient than the microkernel approach as there is no need of invoking message passing.</p></div>
