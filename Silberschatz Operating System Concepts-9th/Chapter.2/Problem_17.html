<div class="answer"> <p>2481-2-6E SA: 8683</p> <p> SR: 4578</p> <p>________________________________________________________________________</p> <p>It would be possible for the user to develop a new command interpreter using the system call interface provided by the operating system because that is how they are made. A command interpreter is simply program that forward commands and arguments to the necessary programs, or make the necessary system calls directly</p> <p>The command interpreter reads commands from the user or from a â—Šle of commands and executes them, usually by turning them into one or more system calls. </p> <p>For example, if we want to delete a file using the UNIX command </p> <p> <i> <b> rm file.txt</b> </i> </p> <p>First it would search for a file called <i><b>rm</b></i>, load the file into memory, and execute it with the parameter <i><b>file.txt</b></i><b>.</b> The function associated with the <i><b>rm</b></i> command would be defined completely by the code in the file <i><b>rm</b></i>. While running this command, we may go across so many system calls. It may find that there is no file with the given name or that file is protected against access. In this case the program should print a message on the console (sequence of system calls) and then terminate abnormally ( another system call). If input file exists then we must delete the file (another system call). It means executing command in command interpreter involves accessing sequence of system calls. So, to develop a new command interpreter by the user, system calls should be available to the user level programs. The system call interface serves as the link to system calls made available by the operating system. In this way user should be able to develop a new command interpreter using the system call interface.</p></div>
