<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Microkernel:</b> </p> <p>It is an approach in operating system to limit the usage of kernel space. It can be done by removing the nonessential components from kernel and implement on the user space. Therefore kernel space is smaller than the user space.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Advantages:</b> </p> <p>1. Microkernel provides efficient communication between the client programs and different services running on the user space. </p> <p>2. Easy to extend the operating system. Because, new services are added easily in user space than the kernel space.</p> <p>3. Easy to port from one hardware design to another design because modifications required in the kernel are less as it has the small space.</p> <p>4. Most of the services are running on the user space therefore it provides more security and reliability.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Interaction in microkernels:</b> </p> <p>User programs and system services are communicated with message passing. Consider the case if a user program wants to access a file; it needs to interact with file server. Interaction between user programs and services like file servers, disks canâ€™t be done directly. Therefore user programs uses message passing to communicate with the file servers.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Disadvantages:</b> </p> <p>The performance of the microkernel is decreased as the overhead due to message passing increases. As the operating system communicates with message passing to interact with the user programs and system services, overhead is increases.</p></div>
