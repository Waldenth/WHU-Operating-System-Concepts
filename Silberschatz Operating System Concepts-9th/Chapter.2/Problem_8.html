<div class="answer"> <p>2481-2-10E SA: 8683</p> <p> SR: 4478 </p> <p>________________________________________________________________________</p> <p>The <b>layered approach</b>, in which the operating system is broken up into a number of layers (or levels), each built on top of lower layers. The bottom layer (layer 0) is the hardware and the highest (layer N) is the user interface.</p> <p>Fig. An operating-system layered approach.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The main advantage of the layered approach is <b>simplicity of construction and debugging</b>.</p> <p>As in all cases of modular design, designing an operating system in a modular way has several advantages. The layers are selected such that each uses functions (or operations) and services of only lower-level layers. So, this approach simplifies debugging and system verification. The first layer can be debugged without any concern for the rest of the system to implement its functions. Once the first layer is debugged, its correct functioning can be assumed while the second layer is debugged, and so on. If an error is found during the debugging of a particular layer, the error confined to that layer, because the layers below it are already debugged. Thus, the design and implementation of the system are simplified when the system is broken down into layers.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Some of the disadvantages or difficulties involved with layered approach are:</b> </p> <p> <b>1</b>. The major difficulty with the layered approach involves the careful definition of the layers, because a layer can use only those layers below it. For example, the device driver for the disk space used by virtual-memory algorithms must be at a level lower than that of memory management routines, because memory management requires the ability to use the disk space.</p> <p>2. Another problem with layered implementations is that they tend to be less efficient than other types. For instance, when a user program executes an I/O operation, it executes a system call that is trapped to the I/O layer, which calls memory management layer, which in turn calls the CPU-scheduling layer, which is then passed to the hardware. At each layer, the parameters may be modified; data may need to be passed, and so on. Each layer adds overhead to the system call, results in layered system takes longer time to execute system call than the non layered system.</p></div>
