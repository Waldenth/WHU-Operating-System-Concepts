<div class="answer"> <p>For certain devices, such as PDAs, cellular phones and game consoles, a disk with a ◊le system may not be available for the device. In this situation, the operating system must be stored in ◊rmware, because firmware usually contains all of the code necessary to boot the operating system. So, devices with small operating system and simple supporting hardware store their operating system in firmware rather than on disk.</p></div>
