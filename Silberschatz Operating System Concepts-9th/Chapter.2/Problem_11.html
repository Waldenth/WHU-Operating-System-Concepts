<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>2481-2-18E SA: 8683</p> <p> SR: 4478</p> <p>________________________________________________________________________</p> <p>Consider a system that would like to run both Windows 7 and three different distributions of Linux (e.g., Red Hat, OpenSuse, and Ubuntu). Each operating system will be stored on disk. During system boot-up, a special program (which we will call the boot manager) will determine which operating system to boot into. This means that rather initially booting to an operating system, the boot manager will â—Šrst run during system startup. It is this boot manager that is responsible for determining which operating system to boot into. Typically boot managers must be stored at certain locations of the hard disk to be recognized during system startup. Boot managers often provide the user with a selection of operating systems to boot into; boot managers are also typically designed to boot into a default operating system if no choice is selected by the user.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The bootstrap program can perform a variety of tasks. It will run diagnostics to determine the state of the machine. If the system passes the diagnostic, then the program can continue with the booting steps. It can also initialize all aspects of the system, from CPU registers to device controllers and the contents of main memory. Sooner or later, it starts the operating system.</p></div>
