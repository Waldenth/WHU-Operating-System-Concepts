<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Security issues</b> </p> <p>The input/output operations are performed in the kernel mode. The kernel is answerable for maintaining the input/output.</p> <p>When any user performs the input/output operation, it will require some software and hardware resources. This is done, to maintain the integrity of the system. When any user performs its own input/output operations, the user will require resources. If the resources are allocated to the user, the integrity of the system will not be maintained.</p> <p>If the integrity of the system is not maintained, the security of that system will never be maintained. Thus, the protection of system with multiple users is very difficult.</p></div>
