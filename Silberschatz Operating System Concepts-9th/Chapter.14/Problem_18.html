<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>HYDRA also provides right amplification this scheme allows a procedure to be certified as trustworthy to act on a formal parameter of a specified type on behalf of any process that holds a right to execute the procedure. </p> <p> In some capability systems (e.g., Hydra), the internal representation of an object is only accessible within the object. If a process is executing outside the object, it has no access to the internal structure of the object. However, when the process is within the object, it must have access. Using amplification, the act of executing within the object automatically provides the process with additional rights, namely the ability to access the internal representation. The rights to be added are specified in an object template.</p> <p> </p></div>
