The object may be <b>hardware object</b> (such as CPU, memory segments, printers, disks and tape drives) (or) <b>software object</b> (such as files, programs and semaphores). If access list of corresponding object contains no access rights, then that object is no longer accessible to any process. Thus, this object will be added to list of garbage collectable objects, and periodically this list can be deleted from memory and the freed space will be returned to the system. </p></div>
