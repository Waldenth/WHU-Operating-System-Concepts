<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> Our model of protection can be viewed abstractly as a matrix called an access matrix. The rows represent domains and the columns represent objects. The access matrix provides an appropriate mechanism for defining and implementing strict control for both static and dynamic association between processes and domain.</p> <p> Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is a facility revolves around privileges. A privilege is a right to execute a system call or to use an option within that system call. Privileges can be assigned to processes, limiting them to exactly the access they need to perform their work. Privileges and programs can also be assigned to roles. Users are assigned roles or can take roles based on passwords to the roles. In this way a user can take role that enables a privilege, allowing the user to run a program to accomplish a specific task.</p> <p> RBAC decreases the security risk associated with superusers .</p></div>
