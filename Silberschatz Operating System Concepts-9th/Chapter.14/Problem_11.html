<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Ring field of a segment descriptor holds the ring number associated to that segment. Actually, as the higher-numbered ring is the subset of ring 0, it canâ€™t access the procedures of ring 0.</p> <p>To allow controlled domain switching, one can modify the ring field of the segment descriptor to include access bracket, limit and list of gates.</p> <p>If a process executing in ring i calls a procedure (or segments) with access bracket (b1, b2) then the call is allowed if b1 <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/9e1/9e18e706-7c98-457b-80fa-51ff5d37c8da/300-14-1e-i1.png" /> <i>i</i><img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/7a0/7a09e64e-59ee-4ff2-a95b-d47b7ba5ece8/300-14-1e-i2.png" /> b2 , and the current ring number on the process remains i.</p> <p> </p></div>
