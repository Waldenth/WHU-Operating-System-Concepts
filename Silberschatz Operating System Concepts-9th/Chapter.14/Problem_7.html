<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Counting the total accesses</b> </p> <p>The access to that object is provided to <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/d8e/d8eb3ccd-6352-41bc-9980-310cfa1ede64/5644-14-7PE-i1.png" /> times. Declare a variable count of int data type and set it to zero. The value of variable count is increased by one at each time when the object is accessed.</p> <p>Thus when the value of count variable is equal to <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/cc9/cc9db849-4c2b-4a15-878a-6e504d6cfc59/5644-14-7PE-i2.png" />, no more accesses are permitted for that object.</p></div>
