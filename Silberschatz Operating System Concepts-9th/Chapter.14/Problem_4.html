<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>2481-14-2E SA: 8683</p> <p>________________________________________________________________________</p> <p> <b>A(x , y) is a subset of A(z , y)</b>.</p> <p> <b>Explanation:</b> </p> <p> Given x is descendant of z, and descendant can never have the ability to do anything that its ancestors cannot do. Suppose if A(z , y) has only Read and Write access rights to object y, then A(x , y) must be either Read or Write or both or no access at all to object y but not have execute permission which is not in A(z , y). From this we can conclude, A(x , y) is subset of A(z , y). </p></div>
