<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> </p> <p>The capability list associated with a domain, but it is never directly accessible to a process executing in that domain. Capability list is itself a protected object, maintained by OS and accessed by user only indirectly. Capability never allowed to migrate into any address space directly accessible by a user process. If all capabilities are secure, the object they protect is also secure against unauthorized access.</p> <p> <u>Strengths:</u> </p> <p>• It provides an efficient means of enforcing access control at runtime.</p> <p>• It allows a user to grant access to other users by providing a copy of required capability.</p> <p> <u>Weaknesses:</u> </p> <p>• Since there are several domains it is difficult to determine which domain corresponds to which object. This can complicate revocation of access rights.</p> <p>• Due to several users propagation of access rights is more complicated to control.</p> <p>• Requires numerous entries per user for typical and has difficulty with establishing who has access to individual files.</p></div>
