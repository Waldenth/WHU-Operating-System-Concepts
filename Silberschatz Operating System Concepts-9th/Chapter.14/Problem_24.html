<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> Consider the anology of a security guard with a pass key. If this key allows the guard into just the public areas that she guards, then misuse of key will result in minimal damage. If however, the pass key allows access to all areas, then damage from its being lost, stolen, misused, copied or otherwise compromised will be much greater.</p> <p> Some of the most famous violations of the principle of least privilege exist in UNIX systems. For example, on UNIX systems, you generally need to have root privileges to run a service on a port number less than 1024. So, to run a mail server on port 25 -- the traditional SMTP port -- a program needs the privileges of the root user. However, once a program has set up shop on port 25, there is no compelling need for it to ever use root privileges again. A security-conscious program would give up root privileges and let the operating system know that it should never require those privileges again (at least, not until the next run of the program). One large problem with some e-mail servers is that they don't give up their root permissions once they have grabbed the mail port (Sendmail is a classic example). Therefore, if someone finds a way to trick such a mail server into doing something nefarious, it will succeed. For example, if a malicious attacker were to find a suitable stack overflow in Sendmail, then that overflow could be used to trick the program into running arbitrary code. Because Sendmail runs with root permissions, any valid attempt by the attacker will succeed. </p></div>
