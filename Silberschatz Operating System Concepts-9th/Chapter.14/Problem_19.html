It is useful in limiting the amount of damage a faulty process can cause in the system by restricting access to the unnecessary resources. For example, when process p invokes procedure A, the procedure should be allowed to access only its own variables and the formal parameters passed to it; it should not be able to access all the variables of process p.</p></div>
