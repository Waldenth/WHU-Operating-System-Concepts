<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Issues in Network – Transparent Systems</b> </p> <p>A network transparent system is essentially a distributed system that isn’t biased for local resources against remote resources. Such a system must appear as a single centralized unit to the user. Implementation of such a system faces multiple issues at design stage.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Some major issues encountered are described below:</p> <p> <b>Resource Transparency</b> – The system must avail all resources such as storage devices and processors to all users. Any user cannot simply use a locally located resource of the system, instead using the entire system as a single unit. This allows complete <b>user mobility</b> where a user connects to the entire system at any location, instead of a local machine. The <b>Network File System (NFS)</b> and the <b>Andrews File System</b> can successfully implement transparency for fairly large systems.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Resource Scalability</b> – The system must be scalable to allow for fault tolerance, and increasing load on the system while maintaining the centralized appearance for the users. Such a scalable system must adjust for all scalability requirements, such that the performance to load ratio of the entire system remains virtually the same. Some inherent issues within scalability are service demand and centralization.</p></div>
