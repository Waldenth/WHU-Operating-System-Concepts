<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Since the system is totally reliable, a stateful approach would make the most sense. Error recovery would seldom be needed, allowing the features of a stateful system to be used. If the network is very fast as well as reliable, caching can be done on the server side. On a slower network caching on both server and client will speed performance, as would file location independence and migration. In addition, RPC-based server is not needed in the absence of failures, since a key part of its design is recovery during networking errors. Virtual-circuit systems are simpler and more appropriate for systems with no communication failures.</p></div>
