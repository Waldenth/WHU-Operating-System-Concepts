<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Dynamic routing is the most complicated to setup and run, it is best way to manage in complicated environments. UNIX provides both fixed routing for use on hosts within sample networks and dynamic routing for complicated network environments. It is also possible to mix the two. Within a site, the hosts may just need to know how to reach the system that connects the local networks to other networks such node known as gateway. Each individual host has a static route to the gateway, although the gateway itself uses dynamic routing to reach any host on the rest of the network.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>When network path A to B is fixed for long time period of applications, then use virtual routing is beneficial instead of dynamic routing, because the virtual routing fixed routing messages from A to B will be delivered in the order in which they are sent.</p></div>
