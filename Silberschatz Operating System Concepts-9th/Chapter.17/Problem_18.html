<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>In general, originators of request/response transactions are free to use the transport they assume is the best in a given situation. However, since TCP has a larger footprint on resource usage than UDP, engines using HTTP over TCP may choose to switch back to UDP by refusing new TCP connections whenever necessary (e.g. too many open TCP connections).</p> <p>TCP is a stream protocol, while UDP is a datagram protocol. That is to say, TCP establishes a continuous open connection between a client and a server, over which bytes may be written--and correct order guaranteed--for the life of the connection. However, bytes written over TCP have no built-in structure, so higher-level protocols are required to delimit any data records and fields within the transmitted bytestream. </p> <p>UDP, on the other hand, does not require that any connection be established between client and server; it simply transmits a message between addresses. A nice feature of UDP is that its packets are self-delimiting--each datagram indicates exactly where it begins and ends. A possible disadvantage of UDP, however, is that it provides no guarantee that packets will arrive in-order, or even at all. Higher-level protocols built on top of UDP may, of course, provide handshaking and acknowledgements. </p></div>
