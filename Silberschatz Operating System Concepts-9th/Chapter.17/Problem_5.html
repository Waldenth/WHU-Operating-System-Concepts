<div class="answer"> <p> <u> <b>Heterogeneous Process Migration</b> </u>:</p> <p>Several networks contain a variety of machines running different operating systems and provide other resources available on machines which have different architectures than the current machine where the process is executing. Using this computational power requires heterogeneous process migration. Heterogeneous process migration<b> </b>is process migration across machine architectures and operating systems. Obviously, it is more complicated than the homogeneous case because it must consider machine and operating specific structures and features, as well as transmitting the same information as homogeneous process migration including process state, address space, and file and communication information. Heterogeneous process migration is especially applicable in the mobile environment where is highly likely that the mobile unit and the base support station will be different machine types. It would be desirable to migrate a process from the mobile unit to the base station and vice versa during computation.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>In same operating system, process migration is easy, as the state of the process needs to migrate from one processor to another. This involves moving the address space, state of the CPU registers, and open files from the source system to the destination. However, it is important that identical copies of the operating system are running on the different systems to ensure compatibility. If the operating systems are the same, but perhaps different versions are running on the separate systems, then migrating processes must be sure to follow programming guidelines that are consistent between the different versions of the operating system. Java applets provide a nice example of process migration between different operating systems. To hide differences in the underlying system, the migrated process (i.e., a Java applet) runs on a virtual machine rather than a specific operating system. All that is required is for the virtual machine to be running on the system the process migrates to.</p></div>
