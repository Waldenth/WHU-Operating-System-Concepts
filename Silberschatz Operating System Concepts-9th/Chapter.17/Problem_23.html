<div class="answer"> <p>Most of the current DFS provide a static, location – transparent mapping for user – level name. These systems however do not support file migration; i.e. changing the location of a file automatically is impossible. Hence location independence is irrelevant for these systems.</p> <p>Location-transparent DFS is good enough in systems in which files are not replicated. Location-independent DFS is necessary when any replication is done.</p></div>
