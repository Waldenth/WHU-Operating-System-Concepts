<div class="answer"> <p>A DFS is a file system whose clients, servers, and storage devices are dispersed among the machines of a distributed system.

It is scalable. It also includes server-side caching in the form of replicas, with high availability through automatic switch over to a replica if the source server is unavailable.</p></div>
