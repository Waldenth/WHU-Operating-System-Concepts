<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Mapping Objects to Virtual Memory</b> </p> <p>A portion of virtual memory which is assigned a <b>byte-for-byte</b> association with some parts of any file is called as memory mapped file. <b>Benefits</b> of mapping an object to virtual memory are given as follows:</p> <p>1. The mapping <b>increases the I/O performance</b> when used for large files and for small files it may be wastage as it increases the slack space.</p> <p>2. Memory mapped file access is <b>faster </b>than direct accessing the files.</p> <p>3. Another benefit of this is that it does lazy loading which in turn uses the <b>small</b> amount of <b>RAM</b> even if the size of the file is larger.</p> <p>4. The files which are loaded one entire page at a time by using memory mapped files. So, it provides <b>file management of pages</b>.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Memory mapped files have some <b>drawbacks</b> also which are described as follows:</p> <p>1. <b>I/O</b> <b>performance</b> is costly because it increases memory copying and system call overhead.</p> <p>2. Memory mapped files causes minor <b>page faults</b> whenever the cache loads a block of data which in turn increases the cost.</p> <p>3. Another drawback is that files larger than given <b>address space</b> can map only some portions at a time which makes it complicated to read the file.</p></div>
