<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> Most widely adopted protocol stack is TCP/IP model, which has been adopted virtually by all internet sites. The TCP/IP protocol stack has fewer layers than ISO model. Theoritically, because it combines several function in each layer, it is more difficult to implement but more efficient than ISO working. TCP/IP application layer identifies several protocols in widespread use in internet, including HTTP, FTP, Telnet, DNS, and SMTP. The transport layer identifies the unreliable, connectionless User Data Protocol and reliable, connection â€“ oriented transmission control Protocol (TCP). The Internet Protocol (IP) is responsible for routing IP Datagram through the Internet. The TCP/IP model does not formally identify a link or physically layer, allowing TCP/IP traffic to run across any physically network.</p> <p> Thus a model with few layers is difficult to implement but efficient by abstracting functions of several layers into few layers.</p></div>
