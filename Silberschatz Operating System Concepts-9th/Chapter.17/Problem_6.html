<div class="answer"> <p>2481-16-17E AID: 76</p> <p> RID: 944 </p> <p> <b>Robust Distributed System</b> </p> <p>a) <b>Failures in a distributed system:</b></p> <p>The distributed system is suffered from various types of hardware failures:</p> <p>1. Link failure.</p> <p>2. Site failure.</p> <p>3. Loss of messages.</p> <p>To ensure a distributed system is robust, any of the above failures must be detected and system is to be reconfigured so that computation can continue.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>b) <b>Centralized system:</b></p> <p>The centralized system is the I/O, file, process and memory management system. So, the site failure and lost data from storage medium failures can occur in the system. The link failure can occur in the network distributed system only.</p></div>
