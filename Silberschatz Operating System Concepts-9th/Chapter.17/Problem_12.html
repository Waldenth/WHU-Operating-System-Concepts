<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>300-16-5E</p> <p> Gateways and routers have dedicated hardware device that run code out of firmware because gateway uses dynamic routing method to reach any hosts on the rest of the network. Dynamic routing is the most complicated to set up and run; however, it is the best way to manage routing in complicated environments.</p> <p> A router is the entity within the computer network responsible for routing messages. A router can be a host computer with routing software or a special - purpose device. Either way, a router must have atleast two network connections, or else it would have nowhere to route message. A router decides whether any given message needs to be passed from the network on which it is received to any other network connected to the router</p> <p> Due to the use of dedicated hardware devices for routers and gateways, the main purpose of routing and message passing is served within less time. But they wonâ€™t serve like general-purpose computers(computations, processing applications, etc).</p></div>
