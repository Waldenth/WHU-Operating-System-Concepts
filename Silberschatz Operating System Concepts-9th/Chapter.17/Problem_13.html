<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Name-server doesn't require local tables to be updated when a machine enters or leaves the system. Because all information is centralized it is easier to maintain the look-up table.</p> <p>Name-server is a problem if the name-server crashes or is cut-off from the network. </p> <p>Suppose if a primary name server crashed. It is possible that no host would be able to have their addresses resolved, making them all unreachable. The solution is to use secondary, backup name servers that duplicate the contents of the primary server. Caches can be used to store frequently requested host information to cut down on network traffic. This method also requires less network traffic.Â </p></div>
