<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Andrew File System</b> </p> <p>AFS was designed to provide support to a lot of clients. Three techniques which make this system scalable are described as follows:</p> <p>1. <b>Caching</b>: It performs caching on files and provides name translations and thus limits the number of operations which is sent to the server.</p> <p>2. <b>Total File Caching:</b> Whenever a file is opened the contents of the file is sent to the client and then no interactions with the server are required.</p> <p>3. <b>Callbacks</b>: The responsibility of the server is to revoke the old copies of files. Clients can use the cached data as many times as they want without making any request to the server for files again and again.</p></div>
