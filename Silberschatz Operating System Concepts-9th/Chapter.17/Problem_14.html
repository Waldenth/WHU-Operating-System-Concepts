<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>This is by far the preferred option for the majority of websites. It is flexible,</p> <p>expandable and easier to manage on a day-to-day basis. Hierarchical organization uses a number of sub-directories stored at the next level down from the website’s root directory. Connected files, grouped either by their file type (for example GIF, PDF) or by their relevance to each other (e.g. business plan 2001), are stored together in their own directory. On the left is an example of a simple architecture for a website. The root file (index.htm) is the homepage that is automatically served when the user requests a web URL containing only the website’s DNS name. The files listed underneath the homepage’s title are also stored in the root directory but are accessed by links from other pages. In the example, other directories have been set up to contain related files. Within the library directory, there are a number of sub-directories for HTML, PDF, RTF and plain-text documents. All images for the website have been grouped together. Within this directory could be many subdirectories for specific areas within the website. It is a good idea to establish a section of the directory structure as a central images repository to ensure that images used through the website are only saved once. Such images could include the organization’s logo graphic, navigational button images, and so on.</p></div>
