<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> If a link fails, this information must be broadcasted to every site in the system, so that the various routing tables can be updated accordingly.</p> <p> Suppose that a link between A and B has failed. When it is repaired both A and B must be notified.</p> <p> One can accomplish this notification by continuously repeating the handshaking procedure that is</p> <p>• Site B is down</p> <p>• The direct link from A to B is down</p> <p>• Alternative path from A to B is down</p> <p>• Message has been lost.</p> <p>Site A cannot determine which of these events has occurred.</p> <p>Suppose that site B has failed. When it recovers, it must notify all other sites that is up again, site B then may have to receive information from the other sites to update its local tables</p></div>
