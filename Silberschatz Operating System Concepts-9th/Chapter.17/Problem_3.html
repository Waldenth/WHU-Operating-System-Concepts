<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b> Advantages of circuit switching:</b> </p> <p>1. Circuit switching provides reliable service means that during transmission packets may not loss.</p> <p>2. It guarantees that the network resources required for a transfer are reserved before the transmission takes place.</p> <p>3. Circuit switching has less overhead for shipping each message.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Disadvantages of circuit switching:</b> </p> <p>1. Circuit switching requires substantial set-up time and may waste network bandwidth.</p> <p>2. It requires a round-trip message to set-up the reservations.</p> <p>3. It also might require overprovision resources.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Application of circuit switching:</b> </p> <p>When network resources are used for long time period applications, then the circuit switching is viable strategy because two parties want to communicate each other, establish permanent communication circuit. No one use that circuit until the communication is terminated by two parties.</p></div>
