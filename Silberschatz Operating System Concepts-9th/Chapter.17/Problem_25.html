<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>A stateful server loses all its volatile state in a crash. Ensuring the graceful recovery of such a server involves restoring this state, usually by a recovery of such a server involves restoring this state, usually by recovery protocol based on a dialog with clients</p> <p>The Cache Manager maintains local copies of remotely accessed files. This is accomplished in the cache by breaking files into chunks of up to 64k (default chunk size). So, for a large file, there may be several chunks in the cache but a small file will occupy a single chunk (which will be only as big as is needed). A "working set" of files that have been accessed on the client is established locally in the client's cache (copied from fileserver(s)).</p> <p> </p> <p> If a fileserver crashes, the client's locally cached file copies remain readable but updates to cache files fail while the server is down.</p> <p> </p> <p> Also, if the AFS configuration has included replicated read-only volumes then alternate fileservers can satisfy requests for files from those volumes.</p></div>
