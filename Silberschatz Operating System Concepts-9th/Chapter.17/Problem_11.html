<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>2481-16-18E AID: 76</p> <p> RID: 944 </p> <p> <b>Network Performance</b> </p> <p>Doubling the speed of the systems on an Ethernet segment results in decreased network performance because, the systems with more speed will send more number of packets in short amount of time (For example, a system can send 1000 packets in 1 unit of time, if the speed of the system is doubled then the system can send 1000 packets in 0.5 units of time).</p> <p>As the number of packets travelling in the network increases the rate of collisions increases. If the rate of collisions in the network increases, the performance of the network decreases. </p> <p>So, if the increase in the speed of the systems on an Ethernet segment will result in decrease of network performance.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The problem can be solved by increasing the number of networks with fewer systems per network (because the rate of collision decrease as the number of packets travelling in the network will be reduced with fewer systems on the network). </p></div>
