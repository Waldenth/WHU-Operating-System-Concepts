<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> </p> <p> One of the most important features of TCP is reliable end-to-end data delivery. In order to provide reliability, TCP must recover from data that is damaged, lost, duplicated, or delivered out of order by the Network layer. TCP uses the Positive Acknowledgment Retransmission (PAR) scheme for achieving reliability. Figure 2, below, shows the PAR scheme, where all data and acknowledgments are received as expected. Data is sent only after previously sent data has been acknowledged. </p> <p> <b /> </p> <p> <b /> </p> <p> <b /> </p> <p> <b /> </p> <p> <b /> </p> <p> <b>Figure 2:</b> PAR scheme illustrating recovery from lost data.</p> <p>TCP implements PAR by assigning a sequence number to each octet that is transmitted and by requiring a positive acknowledgment (ACK) from the receiving TCP module. If the ACK is not received within a time-out interval, the data is retransmitted. At the receiver TCP module, the sequence numbers are used to correctly order segments that may have arrived out of order and to eliminate duplicates. Corruption of data is detected by using a checksum field filled in the TCP packet header. Data segments that are received with a bad checksum field are discarded. </p> <p>Disadvantage is more overhead.</p></div>
