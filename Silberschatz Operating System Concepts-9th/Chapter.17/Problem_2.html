<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Name Translation Cache for Remote Domains</b> </p> <p> <b>Advantage</b>: The DNS maintains a local cache of translated names for remote domains. The primary advantage of using name translation caches for systems in remote domains is <b>performance</b>. Caching a translated name allows the DNS to resolve the remote domain without requiring a new look up for every access. This speeds up the process and allows the name server to resolve names for systems on other remote domains.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Disadvantage</b>: The primary disadvantage of using name translation caches for systems in remote domains is the lack of <b>consistency</b>. When a system name on the remote domain is updated, the change is not reflected in the local cache. This results in incorrect or invalid requests to a system which has moved to a new address. The inconsistency can be resolved by adding either invalidation or automatic updates to the name resolution cache process.</p> <p>A real world example of such an inconsistency is a contact list on a personal cellphone. Consider that a number is saved against a name in the local cellphone. But if the person changes his or her number, the cellphone will now have an invalid number. In this case, the consistency is resolved by the owner of the old number informing the user about change in his number.</p></div>
