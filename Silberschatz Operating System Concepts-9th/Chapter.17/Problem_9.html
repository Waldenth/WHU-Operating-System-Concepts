<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>In computation migration, the file that is requested by a process is accessed at home site and could be initiated by an RPC. An RPC uses a datagram protocol to execute a routine on a remote system.</p> <p>A logical extension of computation migration is process migration. When a process is submitted for execution it is not always executed at the site at which it is initiated. The entire, or parts of it, may be executed at different sites. Computation migration is easy to implement since there is only need to invoke RPC. But in process migration come properties such as load balancing, computation speedup, etc., must be achieved. </p> <p> Web server and web client also provides computation migration. Java, it provides a process migration.</p></div>
