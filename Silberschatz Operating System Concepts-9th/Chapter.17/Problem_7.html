<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Message Acknowledgements in Distributed Systems</b> </p> <p>Distributed Systems in real time scenarios actually are spread over large geographical areas and actually implement the system over a TCP-IP based network such as the internet. Since TCP is primarily implemented using message-acknowledgement-message technique, most distributed systems can easily be implemented using existing protocols instead of designing new and unreliable ones. Hence,<img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/c1b/c1ba56f7-7979-4f4c-8751-1ff83668ad75/5644-16-9PE-i1.png" /> it is highly crucial to acknowledge messages in distributed systems for reliability and to avoid redundancy.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The importance of acknowledgements can be easily demonstrated using real world examples. Consider a case where two individuals – John and Jane agree to meet up for lunch, with John informing Jane about the venue later on. Suppose John sends the message to Jane, but it never reaches her. Now, if there is an acknowledgement protocol in place, Jane can simply call and inform John about non-receipt of his message after time-out. Now, if there is no acknowledgement protocol, John will simply assume that Jane has received the message and will probably turn up at the lunch alone.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Another example can be gleaned from simply using the internet. In case a website is active, the request to access is granted and the web-page requested is downloaded to the user’s browser. Now assume that the website is experiencing technical difficulties and is offline. Now, if there is an acknowledgement protocol in place, the browser receives a no-acknowledgement and informs the user of non-receipt of the request message after time-out. Now, if there is no acknowledgement protocol, the browser will simply assume high server load and keep sending blind requests to the website.</p></div>
