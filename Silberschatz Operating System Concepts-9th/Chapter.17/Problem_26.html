<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The local cache can handle a substantial number of the remote accesses efficiently when caching is used. Capitalizing on locality in file-access pattern makes caching even more attractive. Thus most of the remote accesses will be served as fast as local ones. Servers are contacted occasionally. Hence server load and network traffic are reduced, and potential for scalability is enhanced.</p> <p>Client side caching needs dynamic data replication, whereby each client dynamically defines its own data space of interest. Caching aims to avoid disk-traffic and is done on the server-side only, based on buffering of frequently accessed disk blocks are pages.</p> <p> <u>Disadvantages</u> </p> <p>• The cache consistency problem is the major drawback of caching.</p> <p>• Caching will confer a benefit, execution should be carried out on machines that have either local disks or large main memories. Remote access on diskless small-memory-capacity machines should be done through the remote-service method.</p> <p>• In caching, since data are transferred in masses between the server and client rather than in response to specific needs of a file operation; the lower inter machine interface is different from the upper-user interface. The remote service paradigm is just an extension of the local file-system interface across the network. Thus, the inter machine interface mirrors the local user-file-system interface.</p></div>
