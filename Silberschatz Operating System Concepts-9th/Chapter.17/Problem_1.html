<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>2481-16-2E AID: 268</p> <p> RID: 944 </p> <p> <b>Broadcast in Gateways</b> </p> <p>If all the broadcast packets are passed between all the routers, it causes a lot of network traffic and increases the burden on network. This is the reason; it would be a bad idea for gateways to pass broadcast packets between networks. So the broadcast packet is not re-send by gateways.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The main advantage for gateways to pass broadcast packets between networks is to save the gateway from having to run special software to watch for broadcast packets (such as network routing information processing software). This can be adopted if broadcast traffic were limited to important data.</p></div>
