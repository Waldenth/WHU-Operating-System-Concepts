<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Page is used in the technique paging<b>.</b> Paging is a memory management scheme, which can transfer pages from the secondary storage to the main memory. It can be implemented by breaking the address space into pages and offset values. </p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>• The logical address space is divided into a page number X and an offset value Y.</p> <p>• It is difficult to calculate the page number and the offset value by performing arithmetic operations on the address.</p> <p>• Each bit position in the address represents a power of 2.</p> <p>• To calculate the page number and the offset value more efficiently, split the address bits as even number of bits.</p> <p>• This results to take a page size always powers of 2. So, it takes invariably powers of 2.</p> <p>Page sizes are ranging from the 4,096(2<sup>12</sup>) to 4,194,304(2<sup>22</sup>) bytes.</p></div>
