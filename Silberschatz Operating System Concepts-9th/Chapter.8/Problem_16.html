<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Android mobile OS does not support swap space on account of an extra spacious hard disk storage system. It provides an option of setting up an externally inserted swap space with use of SD (Secure Digital) card. </p> <p>• One can create a swap space for the android device on their non-volatile storage space, that is, SD card. </p> <p>• For this, the operating system usually allows one to extend the physical memory with external resources. After that, a section on that non-volatile memory storage is turned into swap space. </p> <p>• So, in case the system runs into a situation of low memory, the processor could move halted processes to this swap space for the time. Thus, active and fresh processes get even memory space on device’s physical memory.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Advantages of Creating Swap Space on SD Card:</b> </p> <p>There are several reasons behind disallowing a swap space on the physical memory of a mobile operating system and allowing the same on non-volatile memory storage instead. Few of the advantages by doing so are listed below:</p> <p>• The memory type used in SD cards is a very slow memory. Hence, an idle process being swapped out from device’s physical memory will be copied to this very slow memory. </p> <p>It would hardly have an impact on the mobile device performance. </p> <p>Once the processor runs the process being stored in the swap space, it will be swapped in to the physical memory, which is relatively faster and the application’s performance will not be affected as well.</p> <p>• Introducing a swap space on the SD memory prevents any major impacts on the memory management scheme followed up by Android. Hence, the system does not need to run any native scheme for killing active processes until and unless the swap space is highly occupied.</p></div>
