<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>a.</p> <p> <b>Contiguous-memory allocation:</b> In the contiguous-memory allocation, the operating system must reallocate the complete program into the virtual address space. The execution of the program must require more space to execute. But, the memory space is not enough in this memory allocation. Therefore, this memory allocation requires relocation of the address space of the program.</p> <p>b.</p> <p> <b>Pure segmentation: </b>In the pure segmentation, it allows the operating system to extend the memory space to some extent. But, it also requires relocation of the segments of the program and allows to grow the memory towards the virtual address.</p> <p>c.</p> <p> <b>Pure paging: </b>The operating system does not extend the virtual space for the execution of the program. The pure paging requires large page table for spanning the programs in the virtual memory address space. This allocates the new page when the program extends the stack or heap size and the page table entry is reallocated.</p></div>
