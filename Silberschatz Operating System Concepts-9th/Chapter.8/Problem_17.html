<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Paging:</b> </p> <p>• <b>Paging</b> is a form of memory management that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory.</p> <p>• It stores data in a computer and retrieves data from the <b>secondary storage</b> in the <b>main memory</b>.</p> <p>• It is a method of writing data and reading it from the secondary storage for use in the primary storage (main memory).</p> <p>• In an operating system, reading of data from the secondary storage in blocks is called as <b>pages</b>.</p> <p>• It is more efficient and faster to use for storage.</p> <p>• <b>When paging is used</b>, it does not have to comprise a single physically contiguous allocation in the secondary storage.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Segmentation:</b> </p> <p>• It is one of the most common ways to achieve the <b>memory protection</b>.</p> <p>• In a computer system, by using the segmentation it identifies the segments and it includes the memory location.</p> <p>• It stores all the information’s in a segment.</p> <p>• <b>When a process is executed</b>, its corresponding segmentation is loaded into non-contiguous memory.</p> <p>• Although, every segment is loaded into a contiguous block of available memory.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Converting virtual address to physical address:</b> </p> <p>In a memory system, the virtual memory of a program is divided into fixed pages and allocated in fixed sized physical memory frames.</p> <p>• In a program, the runtime mapping of the virtual address to a physical address is done by the <b>memory management unit</b> (MMU).</p> <p>• The mechanism convert virtual address to a physical address is that the base register is added to every address generated by a user process, treated as offset at the time.</p> <p>• The user program deals with the virtual address, it never sees the physical address.</p> <p>• The program uses the virtual address. When the program runs, the <b>hardware </b>converts each virtual address to a physical address.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Solution:</b> </p> <p> <b>Paging with segmentation with respect to the amount of memory required by the address translation structures are:</b> </p> <p>o <b>Paging</b> requires more <b>memory overhead</b> to maintain the translation structures. </p> <p>o <b>Segmentation</b> requires just two registers per segment: one to <b>maintain</b> the base of the segment and the other to maintain the extent of the segment. </p> <p>o <b>Paging,</b> on the other hand, requires one <b>entry per page</b>, and this entry provides the physical address in which the page is located.</p></div>
