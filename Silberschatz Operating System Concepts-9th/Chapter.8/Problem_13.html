<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Memory organization schemes</b> </p> <p> <b>Contiguous memory allocation:</b> </p> <p>a) This memory allocation suffers from external fragmentation since the address spaces are allocated continuously. The gaps in the memory are developed when the old processes dies and the new process are initiated.</p> <p>b) This memory allocation doesn’t suffer from internal fragmentation.</p> <p>c) This memory allocation does not allow processes to share code. Since the memory allocation is continuous, a process’s virtual memory segment cannot break into non – contiguous fine grained segments. So it has no ability to share code across processes.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Pure Segmentation memory allocation:</b> </p> <p>a) This memory allocation suffers from external fragmentation. A segment of a process is in physical memory is laid our continuously. When segments of dead process are replaced by segments of new processes fragmentation can occur.</p> <p>b) This memory allocation doesn’t suffer from internal fragmentation.</p> <p>c) This memory allocation allows processes to share code. A code segment which has distinct data segments can be shared by two different processes.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Pure Paging memory allocation:</b> </p> <p>a) This memory allocation suffers does not suffer from external fragmentation.</p> <p>b) This memory allocation suffers from internal fragmentation. Processes are allocated in page granularity. When a page is not completely utilized, it results in internal fragmentation. Space is wasted corresponding to the internal fragmentation. </p> <p>c) This memory allocation allows processes to share code. At the granularity of the pages, it enables the processes to share code. </p></div>
