<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>a.</b> </p> <p> <b>Translating the logical address into physical address:</b> </p> <p>An Intel Pentium process CPU generates a logical address. which involves following phases to convert it into physical addresses:</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/media%2F210%2F2106665c-0a3e-4767-b0ea-901ee9f5a0f7%2F13258-8-32E-i1.png" alt="8" /> </p> <p>1. Segmentation unit</p> <p>2. Paging unit</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Segmentation unit:</b> </p> <p>• The logical address is given to the segmentation unit.</p> <p>• Logical address has two fields which are selector and offset.</p> <p>o Selector is a 16-bit field which is used as an index to the descriptor table.</p> <p>o Each segment has three fields which are segment number (s), whether the segment is a Local or Global Descriptor table (LDT or GDT) and protection field (<i>p</i>).</p> <p>• The selector filed selects one of the segments and perform an EX-OR with the offset to generate a 32-bit linear address. </p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/media%2Fd93%2Fd93942dd-80d7-46bc-a064-7fc161782320%2F13258-8-32E-i2.png" alt="8" /></p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Paging unit: </b> </p> <p>• The 32-bit linear address is given to the paging unit. It has three fields which are dir, page and the offset.</p> <p>• The filed dir is used as an index to the page directory. The entry from the page directory selects the page table. </p> <p>• The filed page is used as an index to the page table.</p> <p>• The entry of the page table is EX-ORed with the offset to generate the physical address.</p> <p>• The physical memory is accessed by the physical address.</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/media%2Fa21%2Fa212473e-beca-4b06-8a9e-3ff64b1ebf98%2F13258-8-32E-i3.png" alt="Picture 6" /> </p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>b. Advantages to the address-translation system:</b> </p> <p>• The page translation mechanism of an Intel processor provided more flexibility and the kernel implementation is simple.</p> <p>• An operating system implements the entire memory scheme in hardware, instead of having to implement some parts in hardware and some parts in software. </p> <p>• Therefore, the efficiency of the Intel Pentium processor is increasing.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-5</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>c. Disadvantages to the address-translation system:</b> </p> <p>• The translation of logical address into physical address involves multiple table lookups and it takes longer due to invoke each table.</p> <p>• Cache is used in the segmentation unit to read the descriptor but, there will still be cache misses. </p></div>
