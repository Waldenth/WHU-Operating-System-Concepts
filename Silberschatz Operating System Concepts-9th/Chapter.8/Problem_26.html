<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Segmentation and paging are often combined in order to improve upon each other. Segmented paging is helpful when the page table becomes very large. A large contiguous section of the page table that is unused can be collapsed into a single segment table entry with a page-table address of zero. Paged segmentation handles the case of having very long segments that require a lot of time for allocation. By paging the segments, we reduce wasted memory due to external fragmentation as well as simplify the allocation.</p> <p>Â </p></div>
