<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>VAX architecture supports a variation of two – level paging. The VAX is a 32 bit machine with a page size of 512 bytes. The logical address space of process is divided into four equal section, each consists of <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/931/9313b40f-5bca-4ab6-86f4-a90a36e38fbe/300-8-14e-i1.png" />bytes. Each section represents different part of logical address space of a process. The first 2 high – order bits of logical address designate the appropriate section, the next 21 bits represents the logic page number of that section, and final 9 bits represent an offset in desired page, By partitioning in desired page table, OS leave partition unused until a process needs them.</p> <p>Section page offset</p> <table border="1" style="border-collapse:collapse;"> <tr> <td> <p>S</p> </td> <td> <p>P</p> </td> <td> <p>d</p> </td> </tr> </table> <p> 2 21 9</p> <p>The size of one – level page table for VAX process is <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/a0e/a0e44f25-0730-4e45-8bd1-0d3608695240/300-8-14e-i2.png" /></p></div>
