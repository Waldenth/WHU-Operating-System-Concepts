<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Address Space Identifiers (ASIDs) are included in each translation look-aside buffer (TLB)entries because:</p> <p>1. An address-space Identifier provides address-space protection for each process. It is a unique identifier for each process.</p> <p>2. When resolving virtual page numbers by TLB, the ASID of the running process matches with the ASID of the virtual page</p> <p>3. If the ASID of the running process does not match with the ASID of the virtual page it is considered as a TLB miss</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>4. Because of ASID , the TLB contains entries for different processes simultaneously. </p> <p>5. If ASID are not present in each process , then whenever a new page table is selected the TLB must be erased each time for the new running process not to contain wrong translation information.</p> <p>6. Without ASID the TLB would include old entries having valid virtual addresses but pointing to incorrect physical processes of the left over processes.</p></div>
