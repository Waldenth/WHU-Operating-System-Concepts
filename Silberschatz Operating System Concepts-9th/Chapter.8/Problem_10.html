<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The linkage editor needs to change the unresolved symbolic addresses with the actual addresses which is associated with the variables in the program binary. The following is the process to change the address.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>• The object modules should keep track of instructions which refers to unresolved symbols.</p> <p>• During the linking, each object is assigned to a sequence of memory addresses in the entire program binary.</p> <p>• At that time, the unresolved references to the symbols are exported by the program binary could be patched in another module.</p> <p>• Therefore, every other module contains the list of binding instructions which needs to be patched.</p></div>
