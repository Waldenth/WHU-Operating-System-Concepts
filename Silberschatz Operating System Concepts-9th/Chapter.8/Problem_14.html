<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>An Operating system uses a paging scheme to access the memory of the process as described below:</p> <p>• A logical address is generated by the CPU to determine the physical page in the main memory.</p> <p>• The logical address contains page number and offset fields. </p> <p>• The page number provides the frame number of the actual page with the help of page table.</p> <p>• The frame number provides the physical page of the process in the physical memory.</p> <p>The operating system accesses the memory of a process which is own because, it controls the contents of the table and can limit a process to access the pages only which are allocated to the process. </p> <p>Therefore, there is no way to access the page, which not owned by the process.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Possible way to allow access to the other memory:</b> </p> <p>If an operating system allows the entries for non-process memory to the processes page table, it will provide the access to other memory. </p> <p>The main advantage of allowing other memory access is efficient Inter Process Communication (IPC).</p></div>
