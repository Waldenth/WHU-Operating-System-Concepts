<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Purpose of paging the page tables:</b> </p> <p>Paging scheme is used when the size of the page table becomes large and difficult to manage the swapping operations. </p> <p>For example, some large code fragment in the main memory need to be swapped out, it must be placed in a backing store. Since the backing store must have same space to store the large code but practically it is impossible because the size of the code fragments is varying dynamically.</p> <p>To avoid this problem, fixed size of pages is allocated instead of variable chunks. Therefore the total physical address space is allocated with fixed size of chunks in non-contiguous manner. </p> <p>As each page having the same size it is simple to swap the pages form main memory to backing store.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Hence, the main purpose of paging the page tables is to avoid the memory allocation problems.</p></div>
