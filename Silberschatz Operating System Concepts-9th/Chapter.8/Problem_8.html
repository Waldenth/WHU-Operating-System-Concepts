<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>a.</p> <p>Bare-machine as the memory-management scheme will not have any protection, utilities and overhead. Out of all the memory management is the simplest form.</p> <p>It couldnâ€™t provide the protection to the IBM/370, thus to do so set the key of the system to 0.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>b.</p> <p>Here, only one user will do the tasks in parallel mode for IBM/370 such that the system key is set to 0 only when it is in the supervisor mode.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>c.</p> <p>In multiprogramming with a fixed number of processes, the size of the memory region will be fixed such that the region size gets the increments of 2k bytes and thus it allocates the key within the blocks of the memory.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>d.</p> <p>In multiprogramming with the variable number of the processes, the size of the memory region will be fixed such that region size gets the increments of 2k bytes and thus it allocates the key within the blocks of the memory.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-5</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>e.</p> <p>In the paging scheme, the frame size would be incremented by 2k bytes and thus allocation of the key is done with the pages.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-6</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>f.</p> <p>In the segmentation scheme, the size of the segment would be incremented by the 2k bytes and thus allocation of the key is done with the segments.</p></div>
