<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Paging</b> </p> <p>Frames are the fixedâ€“sized blocks of physical memory and pages are basically the blocks of the same size of logical memory. Page table thus consists of page number that is used as an index and the offset of the page. Thus, the effect of allowing the two entries with in the page table so as to point on to the same page frame with in the memory is that by allowing this the user could easily share the code and the data.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>If the code is entered again and again or is reentrant in the memory then large amount of memory space could be saved by using the large programs that includes editors of text, database systems and the compilers. Thus copying the large amount of the memory is effected by having the various page tables that point on to the same location in the memory.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Updating some bytes on one page would effect on the other page in the memory as the nonreentrant data and code shared by the user could access the code and certain modifications made on the code will reflect the other user as the data copy.</p></div>
