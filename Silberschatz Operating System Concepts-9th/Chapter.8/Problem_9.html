<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Systems with fixed-sized allocation units, such as the single-partition scheme and paging, suffer from internal fragmentation. Systems with variable-sized allocation units, such as the multiple â€“partition schemes and segmentation, suffer from external fragmentation.</p> <p>Also internal fragmentation is the area in a region or a page that is not used by the process it is allocated to. The space is wasted until the process terminates. External fragmentation occurs when there is enough free space to satisfy a request for memory, but none of the free \holes" between processes in memory is large enough to satisfy the request.</p></div>
