<div class="answer"> <p>2481-8-17E SA: 8683</p> <p> SR: 4660</p> <p>________________________________________________________________________</p> <p> <b>The following is the mechanism by which one segment could belong to the address space of two different processes</b>. </p> <p> In <b>segmentation mechanism</b>, each process has a segment table associated with it. We have entries in segment table and each entry in the segment table has a <i>segment</i> <i>base</i> and <i>segment</i> <i>limit</i>. The segment base contains the starting physical address where the segment resides in memory, and the segment limit specifies the length of the segment. </p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>One segment of</b> <b>memory</b> <b>would </b><b>belong to the address space of two different processes</b>, when entries in the segment tables of two different processes point to the same memory location. For example, if segment base and segment limit values in the segment tables of both the processes contains the same memory address say 1000 and 300 respectively, then we can say that the particular segment is shared between those two processes. This sharing appears simple, but it must see all sharing processes must define the shared code segment to have the same segment number.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> One of the typical scenarios explaining this situation is <b>Linux on Pentium systems</b> uses only few segments. The segments for user code and user data are shared by all processes running in user mode. This is possible because all processes use the same logical address space and all segment descriptors are stored in the global descriptor table(GDT) which can be accessible to all the processes.</p></div>
