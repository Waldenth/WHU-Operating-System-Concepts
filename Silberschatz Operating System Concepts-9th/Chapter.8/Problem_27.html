<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Reentrant code:</p> <p>The reentrant code remains constant during the execution of the program. The code cannot be changed even if two or more processes use this code at same. </p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Sharing the reentrant module is easier when segmentation is used than when pure paging is used because segmentation does not allow the contiguous address space of a process. Segmentation provides external fragmentation. Paging does not provide external fragmentation. Segmentation uses logical division of the memory and Paging used physical division of the memory. The segments tend to share the same code. Therefore, sharing the reentrant module is easier when segmentation is used than when pure paging is used.</p></div>
