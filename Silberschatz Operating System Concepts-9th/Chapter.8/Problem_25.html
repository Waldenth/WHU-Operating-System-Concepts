<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Two memory accesses are required for a paged memory reference to reach the actual reference.</p> <p>• Access the frame number on basis of page number</p> <p>• Access the data on basis of frame number</p> <p>The time taken for each memory reference is 50 nanoseconds.</p> <p>The time taken to access the page table in RAM is 50 nanoseconds.</p> <p>The time taken to access the data at the memory space is 50 nanoseconds.</p> <p>Hence, the total memory reference time is <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/a82/a824f538-8ff8-4a23-9b53-4866bc6592ef/13258-8-25E-i1.png" /> nanoseconds.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>In case, translation look aside buffers (TLB) with 75% hit ratio are added, the effective memory reference time would be calculated as follows: </p> <p> <b>CASE 1: Page table entry is present in TLB:</b> </p> <p>The time taken for memory reference is equal to the sum of time taken to check TLB and time taken to access the data/Instruction.</p> <p>Time taken to access a page-table entry in the TLBs=2 nanoseconds</p> <p>Time taken to access the data/Instruction =50 nanoseconds</p> <p>Hence, memory access time =<img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/9ec/9ecfc941-35a6-4144-b40c-eb572a9393d3/13258-8-25E-i2.png" /> nanoseconds.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>CASE 2: Page table entry is not present in TLB:</b> </p> <p>The time taken for memory reference is equal to the sum of time taken to check TLB, time taken to fetch page table entry from memory and time taken to access the data/Instruction.</p> <p>Time taken to check TLB=2 nanoseconds</p> <p>Time taken to fetch page table entry from memory=50 nanoseconds</p> <p>Time taken to access the data/Instruction=50 nanoseconds</p> <p>Hence, memory access time =<img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/7ff/7ffd09a1-8fcd-44a2-a711-038717585e4e/13258-8-25E-i3.png" /> nanoseconds.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>As only 75% of all page-table references are found in TLB, thus effective access time is calculated as shown below:</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/066/06691ddf-3f13-449b-a63d-ce4ea05285f7/13258-8-25E-i4.png" /> </p> <p> Hence, effective access time is <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/f72/f7273b92-4fa8-4bd0-99b5-5bfd0b6f4d47/13258-8-25E-i5.png" /> nanoseconds.</p></div>
