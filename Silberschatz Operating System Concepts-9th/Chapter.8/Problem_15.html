<div class="answer"> <p>Swapping is<b> </b>the process performed by an operating system, to swap data between Hard Disk and RAM (Random Access Memory) is known as swapping. In other words, it is a simple memory management technique with which an operating system maintains the efficiency of a processing unit.</p> <p> <b>Reasons why swapping is not supported by iOS and Android:</b> </p> <p>• Mobile operating systems do not opt for swapping memory. Instead they use flash memory. The main reason behind doing so is a mere heck of introducing spacious hard disk storages on mobile devices. </p> <p>Since flash memory can be written for only a limited number of times after which they begin functioning improperly and they also lack bandwidth, swapping is not supported by mobile platforms.</p> <p>• Android uses its own virtual machine that keeps allocating processes to execution. The run time keeps track of process lifetimes so that no process takes entire hold over application memory. </p> <p>As soon as a fresh process requires processor or any other resource in the mobile operating system, the Android run time starts warning current applications to save their state. </p> <p>Once the applications are done with saving their current state, android run time starts killing less important processes which can be restarted from that very state later on.</p> <p>• Similarly, iOS adapts a strategy somehow matching the one in Android mobile Operating System. </p> <p>Rather than having a virtual machine and run time for performing all memory allocation tasks, iOS voluntarily informs all running processes on the main memory to free up some space. The processes which quit by this time can reload their read-only data from the flash memory later. </p> <p>If iOS encounters any problems in getting sufficient free memory for fresh process, low prioritized process are terminated by the operating system itself.</p></div>
