<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Logical address: </b> </p> <p>Logical Address is generated directly by the CPU during the execution of the program or process. It is also called Virtual address.</p> <p> <b>Physical address: </b> </p> <p>A Physical address is generated by the memory unit and is thus loaded with in the memory of memory address register.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>The differences between the Logical address and the Physical address of the main memory is as follows:</b> </p> <table border="1" style="border-collapse:collapse;"> <tr> <td> <p> <b>S.No</b> </p> </td> <td> <p> <b>Logical Address</b> </p> </td> <td> <p> <b>Physical Address</b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> <b>1.</b> </p> </td> <td> <p>Logical address of any program can be viewed by a user.</p> </td> <td> <p>Physical address of a program can never be viewed by a user.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> <b>2.</b> </p> </td> <td> <p>A Logical address consists of the logical address space that consists of the set of all the logical addresses that are generated by the unit of program and is referred to as the abstract address.</p> </td> <td> <p>A physical address space is basically a set of all physical addresses that corresponds to the logical addresses and is referred to as the actual physical address.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> <b>3.</b> </p> </td> <td> <p>Logical address is generated by the CPU directly.</p> </td> <td> <p>Physical address is computed by the device called Memory Management unit.</p> </td> </tr> </table></div>
