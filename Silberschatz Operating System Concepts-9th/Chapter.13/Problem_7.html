<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Stream Driver and Stream Module</b> </p> <p> <b>Stream interface</b> <b>driver</b> provides interaction with the peripherals that <b>produce</b> or <b>consume</b> <b>data</b>. The function of stream interface provides other modules of the software to interact with peripherals.</p> <p> <b>Stream modules</b> are used to process messages which flow through the application and a device driver. It is a pair of <b>initialized</b> <b>queue</b> and the <b>kernel</b> <b>level</b> <b>processes</b>. Differences between stream driver and stream module are given as follows:</p> <table border="1" style="border-collapse:collapse;"> <tr> <td> <p> <b>S.

Hardware interrupts are handled by device drivers.</p> </td> <td> <p>Stream modules are not positioned at the end of the stream and they are not used to solve hardware interrupts.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>2.</p> </td> <td> <p>For more than one time drivers can be at the end of the stream.</p> </td> <td> <p>A module can only be the part of the any stream.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>3.</p> </td> <td> <p>Modules cannot access the structure of user as they donâ€™t have any user context.</p> </td> <td> <p>The same is true for stream drivers but it has got the exception of <b>close</b> and <b>open</b> routines.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>4.</p> </td> <td> <p>A stream driver can have multiple streams associated with it.</p> </td> <td> <p>The multiplexing technique does not apply to stream modules.</p> </td> </tr> </table> </div>
