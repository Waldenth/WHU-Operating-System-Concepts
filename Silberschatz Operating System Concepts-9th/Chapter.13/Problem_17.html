<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Virtual Clock Implementation</b> </p> <p>A clock is an efficient version of FIFO (First In First Out) as pages donâ€™t have to be pushed on the back of the queue. The clock algorithm keeps a track of last examined page frame in the list. If the page frame is not found then fault occurs and a new page frame is loaded in the memory.</p> <p>// Define Data</p> <p>// A list of interrupts which is sorted by the earliest first time order</p> <p>List listOfRequest</p> <p>Define the necessary variables and a timer to track the last pages examined. A timer countTimer which is interrupt based is declared.
