<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>UNIX:</b> </p> <p>UNIX organizes the kernel I/O components actions by operating “shared in-kernel data structures” whereas windows uses “object-oriented message passing”.</p> <p>• The variety of in-kernel data structures are used in kernel I/O components. </p> <p>o It uses the “track network connections”, “character device communications”, and other “I/O activities”.</p> <p>o UNIX provides the file system access to different types of entities such as “user files”, “raw devices”, and “address space of processes”.</p> <p>• UNIX encapsulates these differences within a uniform structure by using the object-oriented techniques.</p> <p>o Windows uses the object-oriented message passing implementation for kernel I/O.</p> <p>• The message-passing approach simplifies the structure and adds flexibility compare to procedural techniques that shared data structures. </p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Pros of UNIX method:</b> </p> <p>• UNIX methods are very efficient method with less overhead and less quantity of data movement.</p> <p>• The design of this method is simple. So, the loss of data is less.</p> <p>• It provides quick implementation. But, there is no coordination between other kernel components.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Cons of UNIX method:</b> </p> <p>• UNIX method is difficult to debug the changes. Because, it possible have more side effects and there is no data protection.</p> <p>• It has difficult “kernel I/O subsystems”, “data structure”, “access routines”, and “locking mechanisms”.</p> <p>• It is difficult to implement the new kernel I/O methods. Because, it requires new data structure instead of new objects.</p></div>
