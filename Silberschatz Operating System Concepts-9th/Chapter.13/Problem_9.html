<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>A device controller can support memory – mapped I/O. The device control registers are mapped into the address space of the processor. </p> <p> <u>Advantages :</u> </p> <p>• The CPU executes I/O requests using the standard data–transfer instructions to read and write the device control register. No separate assembly code is required.</p> <p>• No separate protection is needed, device memory regions are protected via memory protection schemes.</p> <p>• Can use all types of instructions to access memory</p> <p> <u>Disadvantages :</u> </p> <p>Ease of writing to memory – mapped I/O is disadvantage, because a type of software fault is a write through an incorrect pointer to an unintended region of memory, a memory–mapped device register is vulnerable to accidental modification.</p></div>
