<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Blocking I/O is necessary when the process will only be waiting for one specific event. Examples a disk, tape or keyboard read by an application program. Non-blocking I/O is useful when I/O may come from more than one source and the order of I/O arrival is not predetermined. Examples window managers that accept mouse movement as well as keyboard input and I/O management programs such as a copy command that copies data from I/O devices, etc.</p> <p>Non-blocking I/O is more complicated because of the asynchronous I/Os. Also busy waiting is less efficient than interrupt-driven I/O so the overall performance would decrease.</p></div>
