<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Device Controller</b> </p> <p>When the functionality is placed in device controller then it may have some advantages and disadvantages. They are given as follows:</p> <p> <b>Advantages:</b> </p> <p>1. If the functionality is placed in device rather than kernel then errors may cause system to crush.</p> <p>2. If dedicated hardware with hardcore algorithms is used then the performance of the system may increase.</p> <p>3. A kernel can be made simple if the algorithms are removed from it.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Disadvantages</b> of placing functionality in device controller are given as follows:</p> <p>1. To fix the bugs in the devices a new hardware might be needed.</p> <p>2. To improve algorithms in devices is may require an updated hardware or an updated driver for that device.</p> <p>3. The performance of the system might get destroyed if embedded algorithms conflict with the use of application.</p></div>
