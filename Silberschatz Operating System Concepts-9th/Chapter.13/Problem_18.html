<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> </p> <p> <u>Advantage :</u> </p> <p>• It provides a frame work for a modular and incremental approach to writing device drivers and network protocol.</p> <p>• Modules may be used by different streams and hence by different streams and hence by different devices.</p> <p>• It support for message boundaries and control information between modules.</p> <p>• Preferred method for writing protocol and device driver </p> <p> <u>Disadvantage:</u> </p> <p> Message are exchanged between queues in adjacent modules, a queue in one module may overflow an adjacent queue.</p></div>
