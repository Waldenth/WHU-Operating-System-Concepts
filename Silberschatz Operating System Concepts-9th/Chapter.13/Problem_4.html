<div class="answer"> <p>2481-13-8E SA: 8683</p> <p> SR: 4578</p> <p>________________________________________________________________________</p> <p> If I/O operation takes more time to complete, then the polling repeatedly without doing useful work is very inefficient and in the same way if I/O operation takes less time, then using Interrupt driven I/O mechanism is inefficient than polling. So, we will use a <b>hybrid mechanism</b> which will use either polling or Interrupt driven I/O depending on time taken to complete I/O operation. In this hybrid mechanism, we will do polling for specified amount of time and after that if the device is still busy, we would set an interrupt and will switch to another task. </p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> This <b>hybrid approach</b> would avoid long busy-waiting cycles. This method would be efficient for both very long and very short busy times. It would be inefficient if the I/O completes in less time after we switch from polling to Interrupt driven I/O due to the overhead of polling and setting up and catching interrupts. <b>Pure polling</b> is very fast and efficient in a computer environment where I/O operation takes less time to complete. <b>Interrupt driven I/O</b> mechanism is best suited in computer environment where I/O takes more time to complete.</p></div>
