<div class="answer"> <p>2481-13-10E SA: 8683</p> <p> SR: 4578</p> <p>________________________________________________________________________</p> <p> <b>It is possible to implement the handshaking between the host and a controller with only 1 bit, using the following algorithm. </b> </p> <p>In this algorithm both host and controller share the same bit to indicate their status.</p> <p>1. The host repeatedly reads the status bit until that bit becomes clear. This is known as <i>busy waiting</i> or <i>polling</i>.</p> <p>2. The host sets the write bit and writes a byte into the data-out register.</p> <p>3. The host sets the status bit.</p> <p>4. When the controller notices that the status bit is set, it reads the data-out register to get the byte, and does the I/O to the device.</p> <p>5. It clears the status bit when I/O completes successfully.</p> <p>This loop is repeated for each byte.</p> <p> </p></div>
