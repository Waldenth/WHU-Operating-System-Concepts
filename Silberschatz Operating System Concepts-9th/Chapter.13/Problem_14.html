<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>CPU hardware has a wire called the interrupt – request line that the CPU senses after executing every instruction. CPU detects that a controller has asserted a signal on the interrupt – request line, CPU performs a state save and jumps to the interrupt handler routine at a fixed address in memory. Interrupt handler determines the cause of interrupt, perform necessary processing, perform a state restore and execute a return from interrupt instruction to return the CPU to the execution state prior to interrupt. Here also the same might happened. After executing the first piece of code CPU might have detected an interrupt, handled it and then continued to execute the remaining piece of code. This is favorable for higher priority tasks.</p></div>
