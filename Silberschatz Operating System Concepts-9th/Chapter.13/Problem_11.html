<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>A system that supports multiprogramming requires virtual addresses for accessing memory space via user programs. Simultaneously the systems operating system requires physical address for accessing memory space on account of its operations. This discussion would be concentrating on how these basic Input / Output and operating system operations are carried out.</p> <p>Consider the concept of operations performed by a system when a user programs requires access through the memory space. The entire process includes some steps as follows:-</p> <p>• Initially the process starts up with specifying a buffer that is dedicated to transmit data from the device towards application running the program and retransmitting the obtained results to the output device. This buffer typically works on the basis of a logical or virtual address for referencing things from and to memory space.</p> <p>• Similarly, the system Kernel has a separate buffer that acts as an intermediate between the introduced buffer and itself. A kernel buffer is mandatory for noting down all entries before and after an I/O operation. </p> <p>• While accessing the user buffer Kernel translates the virtual address attached with the buffer into corresponding physical address.</p> <p>• In case of any fault or absence of user buffer, the pages are simultaneously fetched from the systems’ swap space.</p></div>
