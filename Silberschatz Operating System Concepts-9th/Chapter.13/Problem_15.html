<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Some computer architectures use physical memory addresses for DMA, but other perform DVMA (Director Virtual Memory Access), using virtual address that undergo translation to physical addresses Due to this complexity increases in DMA with an extra translation of virtual address to physical address. . DVMA can perform a transfer between two memoryâ€“mapped devices without the intervention of CPU or the use of main memory.</p></div>
