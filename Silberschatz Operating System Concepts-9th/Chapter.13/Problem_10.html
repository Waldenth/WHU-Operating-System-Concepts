<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Solution:</b> </p> <p>(a)</p> <p>A <b>mouse</b> used with a graphical user interface. </p> <p>• <b>Buffering</b> may be needed to record mouse movement during times when higher-priority operations are taking place.</p> <p>• To retrieve buffered data from the mouse, the user needs to set the buffer.</p> <p>• So that buffering is important, it can hold data in transit of data from a device.</p> <p>• In mouse,<b> Spooling</b> and <b>caching</b> are inappropriate. </p> <p>• <b>Interrupt-driven</b> I/O is also most appropriate.</p> <p>• Here, <b>Polling</b> is the simplest way for an I/O device that communicates with the processor.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>(b)</p> <p>A <b>tape drive</b> on a multitasking operating system.</p> <p>• It is a data storage device that reads and writes data on a magnetic tape.</p> <p>• A <b>tape storage</b> device is used to archive data.</p> <p>• <b>Buffering</b> may be needed to manage throughput difference tape drive and the source or destination of the I/O. </p> <p>• <b>Caching</b> can be used to hold copies of data that resides on the tape, for faster access.</p> <p>• <b>Spooling</b> could be used to stage data to the device when multiple users desire to read from or write to it.</p> <p>• <b>Interrupt-driven</b> I/O is likely to allow the best performance.</p> <p>• Also, <b>Polling</b> is a behaviour which polls the tape drives with a service.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>(c)</p> <p>A <b>disk drive</b> contacting user files.</p> <p>• A disk drive is used to control the buffer data in a disk called as disk duffer.</p> <p>• <b>Buffering</b> can be used to hold data while in transit from user space to the disk, and vice versa.</p> <p>• <b>Caching</b> can be used to hold disk-resident data for improved performance. </p> <p>• <b>Spooling</b> is not necessary because disks are shared-access devices.</p> <p>• <b>Interrupt-driven</b> I/O is best for devices such as disks that transfer data at slow rates.</p> <p>• Here, <b>Polling</b> makes no sense; it does not access the external hard disk drives.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>(d)</p> <p>A <b>graphics card</b> with direct bus connection, accessible through memory-mapped I/O.</p> <p>• It is a piece of computer hardware that produces the image to render it on a monitor.</p> <p>• For example, the video games that are played in a system.</p> <p>• <b>Buffering</b> may be needed to control multiple access and for performance.</p> <p>• <b>Caching</b> and <b>Spooling</b> are not necessary due to the fast and shared-access natures of the device.</p> <p>• <b>Polling</b> and <b>Interrupts</b> are only useful for input and I/O completion detection, neither of which is needed for a memory-mapped device.</p></div>
