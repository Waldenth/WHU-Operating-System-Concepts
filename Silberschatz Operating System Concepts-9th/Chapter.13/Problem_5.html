<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Direct Memory Access (DMA)</b> </p> <p>Direct memory access is the way of CPU to grant authority to I/O module to read from or write to memory direct without any interference. DMA monitors and controls the exchange of information from main memory to I/O devices. With the help of DMA any device can transfer information directly to memory and from memory in spite of using CPU as intermediate.</p> <p>• It <b>increases the concurrency</b> of the system as it makes free the CPU to perform other activities when it itself handles the data transfer from and to the disk.</p> <p>• It <b>complicates the system</b> as it needs DMA controller as a special hardware which manages the data transfer and system bus. These controllers are hard to program as they need source and destination pointers, to know the location of data to be written.</p></div>
