<div class="answer"> <p>2481-13-13E SA: 8683</p> <p> SR: 4578</p> <p>________________________________________________________________________</p> <p> In general CPU operation is faster than I/O device and CPU sits idle most of the time if I/O takes more time to complete. So, if we increase the CPU speed without increasing the speed of system bus and I/O device will lead to decrease in system performance. To solve this we must increase system bus and device speeds as the CPU speed increases. </p></div>
