<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Interrupt-controller hardware detects the interrupt, dispatches it to the proper interrupt handler and assigns priority. Interrupt chaining is a technique in which each elements in the interrupt vector points to the head of a list of interrupt handlers when an interrupt is raised, the handlers on the corresponding list are called one by one until one is found that can service the request. This structure compromise between the over head of a huge interrupt table and the inefficiency of dispatching to a single interrupt handler. Another overhead is assigning priorities to the interrupts. Another is disabling interrupts while handling a critical section.</p></div>
