<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Time quantum</b> is also known as time slice. It is small unit of time. Time quantum is used in time sharing system. </p> <p>Time quantum and priority are inversely proportion to each other. Higher priority refers lesser the time quantum and vice versa.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>According to the Solaris operating system for time sharing needs the time quantum (in milliseconds) for a thread with priority 15 is 160 and for a thread with priority 40 is 40 (according to figure 6.23).</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>A thread with priority 50 has used its entire time quantum without blocking, so the scheduler will assign a new priority to this thread that is 40 (according to figure 6.23).</p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>A thread with priority 20 blocks for I/O before its time quantum has expired, so the scheduler will assign a new priority to this thread of 52 (according to figure 6.22).</p></div>
