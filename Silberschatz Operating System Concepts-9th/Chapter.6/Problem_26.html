<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>• The combination of REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS and TIME_CRTICAL priority provides the highest possible relative priority that is 31. </p> <p>• Assume there is no threads belong to the REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS and that none may be assigned a TIME_CRTICAL priority.</p> <p>• If above condition is true then a combination of HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS and HIGHEST priority within that class with a numeric priority of 15 corresponds to the highest possible relative priority in Windows scheduling (According to figure 6.22).</p></div>
