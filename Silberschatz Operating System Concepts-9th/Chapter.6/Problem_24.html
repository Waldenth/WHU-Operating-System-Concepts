<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>(a) FCFS</b>—discriminates against short jobs since any short jobs arriving after long jobs</p> <p>will have a longer waiting time.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>(b) RR</b>—treats all jobs equally (giving them equal bursts of CPU time) so short jobs will</p> <p>be able to leave the system faster since they will finish first.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>(c)Multilevel feedback queues</b>—work similar to the RR algorithm—they discriminate</p> <p>favorably toward short jobs.</p></div>
