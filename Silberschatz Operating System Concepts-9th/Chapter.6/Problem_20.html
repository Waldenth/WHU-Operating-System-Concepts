<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>a)</b> </p> <p>• <b />If the two pointers referred to the same process in the ready queue using Round Robin scheduling Algorithm, the process priority get increased every time. </p> <p>• This phenomenon also called receiving preferential treatment. </p> <p>• Preferential treatment means take the advantage over the other process in the ready queue which are having more priority.</p> <p>Consider the two pointer <b>p</b><sub>1</sub> and <b>p</b><sub>2</sub> have the same references to the Process <b>P</b><sub>1</sub> and these two pointers are put in the ready queue at time quantum <b>t.</b></p> <p>Then each process gets ½ = 50% of CPU time with at most ‘t’ time units.</p> <p> Each process waits for maximum time i.e (2-1)xt time unit until its next time quantum.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>b)</b> </p> <p>The two-major advantage of this preferential treatment scheme is as follows:</p> <p>• In the Process control block, the CPU can give high priority to the Important processes. Hence, the important process will complete the job first.</p> <p>• Higher Priority in the received treatment.</p> <p>The Disadvantages<b> </b>preferential treatment are as follows:</p> <p>• Shorter jobs will suffer to wait in the ready queue for its execution.</p> <p>• Less Priority.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>c)</b> </p> <p>The best advice to modify the RR algorithm to avoid this issue without the duplicate pointers is allot a longer amount of time to processes deserving higher priority. </p> <p>It means provide various time quantum to complete the jobs one after the other in the RR scheduling algorithm.</p></div>
