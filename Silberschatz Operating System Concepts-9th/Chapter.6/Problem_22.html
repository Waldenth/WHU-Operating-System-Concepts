<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>One possibility:</p> <p>If the program uses only a large fraction of its time quantum and not the entire time quantum,Â thereby increase of priority associated with that process, The program could maximize the CPU time allocated to it by not fully utilizing its time quantums. </p> <p>Another Possibility: </p> <p>Round Robin Scheduling: A multilevel queue scheduling algorithm partitions the ready queue in several separate queues. The processes are permanently assigned to one queue, based on memory size, process priority, process type. </p> <p>Breaks a process up into many smaller processes and dispatch each to be started and scheduled by the operating system. Separate queue might be used for foreground and background processes. Foreground queue might be Round Robin where as background may be FCFS algorithm.</p></div>
