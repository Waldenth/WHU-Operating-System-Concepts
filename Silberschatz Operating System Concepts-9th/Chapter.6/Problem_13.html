<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>There are two ways for maintaining a queue of processes for a processor:</p> <p>• Processing core having its own run queue</p> <p>• All processing core sharing single run queue</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Processing core having its own run queue: </b>In this method each CPU works on its own local run queue. A processor can takes the process directly from queue.</p> <p> <b>Advantages: </b> </p> <p>• The processes present on the run queue are evenly distributed across the processor maintaining that run queue. This is known as load balancing.</p> <p>• There is no interference or conflict even if two or more processors are making use of a scheduler simultaneously. </p> <p>• At the time of making decision for a processing core, scheduler only requires to look at its local run queue.</p> <p> <b>Disadvantages:</b> </p> <p>• Extra required for maintaining different queue for different processor.</p> <p>• Each processor has its own queue so when some processor’s queue get completely empty then that processor get idle where as it might be possible that other processors are busy.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>All processing core sharing single run queue: </b>In this method there is only one run queue which is shared by all CPU. Whenever any process assign a processor then process is taken from shared queue.</p> <p> <b>Advantages</b> <b>: </b> </p> <p>• This method leads to better utilization of processor.</p> <p>• Any CPU that is idle can extract a runnable process from the common run queue and executes it.</p> <p>• No extra work is required for maintaining different queue for different processor.</p> <p> <b>Disadvantages:</b> </p> <p>• There is load balancing problem in shared queue method.</p> <p>• When there are different run queues, this can even lead to deadlock state if not protected with any locking scheme.</p></div>
