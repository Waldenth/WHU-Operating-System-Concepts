<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Rate-monotonic scheduling is the scheduling algorithm which is used today in real-time operating system. In this static-priority scheduling class is being used. In case of static-priority scheduling class if the duration of the cycle is short then priority of the job will be higher. </p> <p>Earliest - deadline – first scheduling places a process in priority queue which is having a due deadline that means the process which is near its deadline given the highest priority, whereas <b>rate-monotonic scheduling</b> places a process in priority queue having shorter period which leads to higher priority. </p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Circumstances where rate-monotonic scheduling algorithms are inferior in comparison to the earliest-deadline first scheduling algorithm in meeting the processes are as follows:</p> <p>• In case of static priority assignment rate monotonic is preferred whereas in case of dynamic priority assignment earliest deadline first assignment is preferred. </p> <p>• When tasks-sets with the higher processor utilization is required then in that situation Rate-monotonic scheduling algorithm is not preferred. </p></div>
