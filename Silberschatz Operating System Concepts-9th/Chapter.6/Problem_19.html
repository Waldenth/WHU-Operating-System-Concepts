<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Starvation due to scheduling algorithms</b> </p> <p> <b>First – come, first – served (FCFS) algorithm</b>: This scheduling algorithm allocates the CPU (Central Processing Unit) resources to the process that requests the resources first. </p> <p> <b>Shortest – Job – First (SJF):</b> This scheduling algorithm allocates the CPU (Central Processing Unit) resources to the process that has the smallest CPU burst.</p> <p> <b>Round – robin</b>: This scheduling algorithm allocates the CPU (Central Processing Unit) resources to each of the process in the circular queue for a time interval of up to 1 quantum (Time quantum is a small amount of generally from 10 to 100 milliseconds). </p> <p> <b>Priority Scheduling</b>: This scheduling algorithm allocates the CPU (Central Processing Unit) resources to the process that has the highest priority (a priority is associated with each process).</p> <p> <b>Among all the four scheduling algorithms Shortest – Job – First and Priority scheduling could result in starvation. </b> </p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>In the Shortest – Job – First scheduling algorithm, the longest job will be in the indefinite blocking or starvation. Starvation arises when shortest jobs keep on arriving before the current shortest job completes its execution. In this case, the shortest job is always available to execute and longest job will starve. </p> <p>In the Priority scheduling algorithm, the lowest priority job will be in the indefinite blocking or starvation. Starvation arises when highest priority job keeps on arriving before the current highest priority job completes its execution. In this case, the highest priority job is always available to execute and low priority job will starve. </p> <p> <b>Therefore, Shortest – Job – First and Priority scheduling could result in starvation. </b> </p> </div>
