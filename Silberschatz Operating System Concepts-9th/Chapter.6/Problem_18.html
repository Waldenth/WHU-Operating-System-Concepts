<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Nice value</b> is used to provide a specific priority to the process at the time of invoking or calling. </p> <p>• The default nice value is 0.</p> <p>• The limits of nice value are -20 to +19.</p> <p>• A lower nice value indicates a higher priority. It means -20 indicates a highest priority. </p> <p>• A higher value indicates a lower priority. It means 20 or 19 shows the lower priority.</p> <p>• A higher priority process is always assigned more CPU time than a low priority process. </p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The non- root processes are allowed to assign nice values greater than or equal to zero. </p> <p>• If the non- root processes are allowed to assign nice values less than zero, then all the non- root processes will provide themselves a higher priority. </p> <p>• Then there will be an issue to which non-root processes the CPU is to allocated as they are all of high priority.</p> <p>Hence, the root user can only be allowed to assign nice values less than zero.</p></div>
