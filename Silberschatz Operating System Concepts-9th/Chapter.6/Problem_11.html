<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>CPU utilization and response time:</b> </p> <p>• Generally, CPU utilization should be maximized and response time should be minimized.</p> <p>• CPU utilization can be maximized by minimizing the time spent in context switching, as the CPU is idle during context switching. </p> <p>• The time taken from the submission of request to time the first response is produced is called the response time. </p> <p>• When context switching is done rarely, then it would indeed result in decrease in the response time.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> </p> <p> <b>b.</b> </p> <p> <b>Average turnaround time and maximum waiting time:</b> </p> <p>• Generally, average turnaround time and average waiting time should be minimized.</p> <p>• The interval from the time of submission of a process to the time of completion of a process is the turnaround time. </p> <p>• Turnaround time is the time spent by a process waiting to get into memory, waiting in the ready queue, executing on CPU, and doing I/O. </p> <p>• Waiting time is the time spent by a process waiting in the ready queue.</p> <p>• The average turnaround time can be minimized by executing the jobs with shortest CPU bursts. </p> <p>• If the jobs with shortest CPU bursts are executed first, then it will indeed increase the waiting time of the jobs with large CPU bursts and thus it will maximize the waiting time.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>c.</b> </p> <p> <b>I/O device utilization and CPU utilization:</b> </p> <p>• Jobs can be categorized into CPU bound jobs and I/O bound jobs.</p> <p>• I/O bound jobs spend most of the time using I/O devices and spend less time doing computation using CPU.</p> <p>• CPU bound jobs spend most of the time doing computation using CPU and spend less time using I/O devices.</p> <p>• CPU utilization can be maximized by executing CPU bound jobs that have large CPU bursts.</p> <p>• I/O device utilization can be maximized by executing I/O bound jobs. As soon as the I/O device is free, it can be allocated to an I/O bound job.</p></div>
