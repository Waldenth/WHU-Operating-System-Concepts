<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>A <b>CPU bound</b> process is one which has more CPU bound operations and an <b>I/O bound</b> process is one which has more of I/O bound operations. </p> <p>• In the given scheduling algorithm, each process has initial 50 milliseconds of time quantum and a priority.</p> <p>• So, if a process utilizes all of its time quantum, then 10 milliseconds more are assigned to it and its priority is also increased. This type of process is CPU bound process.</p> <p>• On the other hand, when a process blocks for I/O before utilizing its full-time quantum, then its time quantum is reduced by 5 milliseconds but the priority remains same. This type of process is I/O bound process.</p> <p>• It can be induced that after completion of each round, a CPU bound process gets more time quantum for execution and its priority is also increased.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Hence, a regressive round-robin scheduler favors CPU-bound processes.</b> </p></div>
