<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Importance of distinguish I/O-bound and CPU-bound programs </b> </p> <p>The scheduler need to distinguish I/O (Input/Output) – bound programs from CPU (Central Processing Unit) – bound programs for efficient use of computer resources. The scheduler efficiency depends on the optimum utilization of CPU. This can be achieved by observing the properties and distinguishing the programs.</p> <p>I/O-bound programs utilize small amount of CPU resources. They have the property of performing small amount of computations before performing IO. This property makes I/O-bound programs not to use their entire CPU quantum.</p> <p>CPU-bound programs utilize large amount of CPU resources. They have the property of performing computations without performing any blocking IO operations. This property makes CPU-bound programs to utilize their entire CPU quantum.</p> <p>Based on these properties of I/O-bound and CPU-bound programs, scheduler should distinguish and give priorities. <b>Scheduler should give high priority to I/O-bound programs.</b> It should allow I/O-bound programs to execute before the CPU-bound programs. This scheduling will help in better utilization of computer resources. </p></div>
