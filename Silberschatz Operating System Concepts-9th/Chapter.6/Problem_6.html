So, they usually have used less CPU time in the recent past than other process. As soon as they are done with an I/O burst, they will get to execute on the processor. So this algorithm will favor I/O bound programs.</p> <p> CPU-bound programs would spend more time on executing programs than I/O. However, since the algorithm takes into account only recent history, the CPU bound processes will not starve permanently. If a process has been prevented from using the processor for some time, it becomes one of the processes that have the least CPU time(=0) in the recent past and eventually it will get a chance to use CPU.</p></div>
