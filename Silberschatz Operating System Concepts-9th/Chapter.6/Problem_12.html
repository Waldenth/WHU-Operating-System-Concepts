<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Lottery ticket are based on the probabilistic scheduling algorithm in which each processor are provided with some number of lottery tickets and scheduler make decision of picking next process by drawing random ticket.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Since every process are assigned a lottery ticket so if higher-priority processes are assigned more tickets, than the BTV scheduler can assure that threads which are higher priority gain more consideration from the CPU than threads that have lower priority. The reason behind is that the process which have more tickets has higher probability of getting the CPU.</p></div>
