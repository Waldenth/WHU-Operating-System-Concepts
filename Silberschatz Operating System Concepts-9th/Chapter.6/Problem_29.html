<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>In<b> Proportional share scheduler, </b>some CPU time is previously allocated to each processor and every job contains certain weight. And on the proportion of the weight, each job gets the part of available resources.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>A <b>priority inversion problem</b> is one in which a resource required by a high priority process is being acquired by a low priority process and that has preempted by medium priority process. </p> <p>Due to which the highest priority process cannot be implemented before the medium priority process and lower priority process.</p> <p> <b>Example:</b> A and B are 2 processes A has higher priority than B and B acquire an exclusive shared resource that is required by the A. let C be a medium priority that comes into existence. If B is running, A and C is blocked. </p> <p>B can be preempted by C as it has higher priority. But A cannot run before B as A needs that resource which is acquired by B. So the priority of A and B is inverted.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The solution to this problem is that a high priority process and a low priority process should interchange their priorities only till the high priority process completes its work with the resource, after that priorities can be same as initial. </p> <p>This can be a solution which can be implemented within the context of a proportional share scheduler.</p></div>
