<div class="answer"> <p> <b>(a)</b> </p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/1a3/1a35531f-4f1c-43dd-852b-a87507e7b302/13258-6-23E-i1.png" /> </p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/d51/d516eeec-0d3b-444b-b374-7a5659153bd9/13258-6-23E-i2.png" /> is the rate of change of priority when the process is running</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/232/232ee71c-7359-424d-b7fe-0d3550b3cc51/13258-6-23E-i3.png" /> is the rate of change of priority when the process is waiting</p> <p>0 is the rate when the rate when the process entered in ready queue.</p> <p>• From the above question, all the processes having initial priority of 0 when it is entered into the ready queue.</p> <p>• The priority is increased when the process is running from the ready state at the rate <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/215/215fabff-a636-4d9e-a098-ff448c71fa39/13258-6-23E-i4.png" /> which is greater than 0. Therefore, the highest priority of the process is <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/a88/a88f7f35-e97c-4469-9c2b-5eaab9a2bf9b/13258-6-23E-i5.png" />.</p> <p>• When the highest priority process is running (the first processes which entered into the ready queue), its priority is increasing at a rate (<img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/b58/b5838edc-69bf-42cb-939f-eb0f4f906e54/13258-6-23E-i6.png" />). Therefore, no other processes will preempt until its completion.</p> <p>• As the highest priority processes running is higher than the processes which are waiting, it seems to be a <b>First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)</b> algorithm. The processors which are waiting for a long time will be run and its priority is increasing. <i> </i></p> <p> </p> <p>Hence, the algorithm results from the equation are <b>FCFS</b>. </p> </div>

<div class="answer"> <p> <b>(b)</b> </p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/8cf/8cf2eb90-d953-41cf-848d-c7b9247cafc6/13258-6-23E-i7.png" /> </p> <p>• As the highest priority processes are running, no other processes which are in the ready queue will not preempt the running process. Therefore, its priority is decreasing at a rate <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/167/167171d0-ffd8-416e-ab19-fda0e56f5d6b/13258-6-23E-i8.png" />.</p> <p>• But, the process can be preempted by the new processes because when the new process enters into the ready queue, its initial priority is 0. The 0<sup>th</sup> priority is greater than the priority of the waiting process <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/898/89877a91-7019-4db2-bc83-e8c12c087b00/13258-6-23E-i9.png" /> . </p> <p>Therefore, the last come process is served first. Therefore, the algorithm results from the explanation is <b>LIFO (Last In First Out).</b></p></div>
