<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Windows scheduling algorithm uses 2 type of scheduling algorithm, one is priority based scheduling and preemptive scheduling algorithm.</p> <p>There are 6 priority classes given below as: </p> <p>• IDLE_PRIORITY_CLASS </p> <p>• BELOW_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS </p> <p>• NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS</p> <p>• ABOVE_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS</p> <p>• HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS</p> <p>• REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS </p> <p>The values can be: IDLE, LOWEST, BELOW_NORMAL, NORMAL, ABOVE_NORMAL, HIGHEST, TIME_CRITICAL.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>A thread in the REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS with a relative priority of NORMAL is 24 (given from figure 6.22).</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>A thread in the ABOVE_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS with a relative priority of HIGHEST is 12 (given from figure 6.22).</p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>A thread in the BELOW_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS with a relative priority of ABOVE_NORMAL is 7 (given from figure 6.22).</p></div>
