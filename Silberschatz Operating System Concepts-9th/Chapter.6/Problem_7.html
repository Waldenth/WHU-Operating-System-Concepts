<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Scheduling</b> </p> <p>The difference between <b>Process Contention Scope</b> or <b>PCS</b> scheduling and <b>System Contention Scope </b>or <b>SCS</b> scheduling is explained in the table given below:</p> <table border="1" style="border-collapse:collapse;"> <tr> <td> <p> <b>S.
