<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>2481-5-2E SA: 8683</p> <p> SR: 4578</p> <p>________________________________________________________________________</p> <p> Given that there are <i>n</i> processes to be scheduled on one processor, and the first schedule can be done for any of the <i>n</i> processes, the total numbers of possible schedules in terms of ‘n’ are <b>factorial of n</b> => <b>n! (</b>n! = n×n –1×n–2×...×2×1).</p> <p>For example, for 1 process, there is only one possible ordering: (1), for 2 processes, there are 2 possible orderings: (1, 2), (2, 1). For 3 processes, there are 6 possible orderings: (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), (3, 2, 1). For 4 processes, there are 24 possible orderings. So, for <i>n</i> processes, there are <i>n</i>! possible orderings.</p></div>
