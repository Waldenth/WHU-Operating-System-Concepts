<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Consider the data for the three processes and the recent CPU usage are as follows: </p> <table border="1" style="border-collapse:collapse;"> <tr> <td> <p> <b>S. No</b> </p> </td> <td> <p> <b>process</b> </p> </td> <td> <p> <b>Recent CPU usage</b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>1</p> </td> <td> <p>P1</p> </td> <td> <p>40</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>2</p> </td> <td> <p>P2</p> </td> <td> <p>18</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>3</p> </td> <td> <p>P3</p> </td> <td> <p>10</p> </td> </tr> </table> <p> </p> <p>Formulae to compute priority is as follows: </p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/bf1/bf1f4265-6946-4b17-b7eb-87be38d0074d/13258-6-9PE-i1.png" /> </p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Compute the priorities for each process as follows:</p> <p>• For process P1, substitute the recent CPU usage as 40 and base is 60:</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/900/90021d92-1b05-40ee-8288-f8c34a6e4f72/13258-6-9PE-i2.png" /> </p> <p>• For process P2, substitute the recent CPU usage as 18 and base is 60:</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/6b4/6b4270a5-3efc-406d-a9ff-8db194045383/13258-6-9PE-i3.png" /> </p> <p>• For process P3, substitute the recent CPU usage as 10 and base is 60:</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/a2c/a2c6476e-9405-4680-941b-c593caad49bd/13258-6-9PE-i4.png" /> </p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>From the above data the priorities for the three processes P1, P2, and P3 are 80, 69 and 65 respectively.</p> <p>Here process P1 has the highest priority, P2 is the next priority and P3 has the lowest priority.</p> <p>In traditional Unix scheduler the process priority is dynamic. The priorities are raised or lowered depends on the CPU interval time to execute a process by adjusting the priorities dynamically. </p> <p>Hence, from the above information the first process is ready for execution which has highest priority, but the CPU time is 40(higher compared to other process). So, scheduler cannot wait longer time to wait for the first process execution, So, the priorities are lowered.</p></div>
