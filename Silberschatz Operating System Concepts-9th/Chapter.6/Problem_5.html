<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>CPU Scheduling Algorithms</b> </p> <p>a. The relationship between priority and SJF or Shortest Job First is that the shortest job has the highest priority and is served first.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>b. The relationship shared between Multilevel Feedback Queues and FCFS or First Come First Serve is that the lowest level of Multilevel Feedback Queues is First Come First Serve.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>c. The relationship between priority and FCFS or First Come First Serve is that First Come First Serve assigns the highest priority to the job that has been in existence the longest time, thus serving the job that came first before the others.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>d. There is no relationship between the two scheduling algorithms RR or Round Robin and SJF or Shortest Job First. RR is a preemptive scheduling algorithm whereas SJF is a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm.</p></div>
