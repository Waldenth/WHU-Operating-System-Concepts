<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> In SCAN algorithm, the disk arm starts at one end of the disk, and moves towards the other end, servicing requests as it reaches each cylinder, until it gets to the other end of the disk. At the other end, the direction of head movement is reversed, and servicing continues. The head continuously scans back and forth across the disk. </p> <p> C-SCAN is designed for more uniform wait. Like SCAN, C-SCAN moves the head from one end of the disk to the other, servicing requests along the way. When the head reaches the other end, it immediately returns to the beginning of the disk, without servicing any requests on return trip. It treats the cylinder as a circular list that wraps around from the final cylinder to the first one.</p> <p> C-SCAN has an average response time just a few percent higher than SCAN but C_SCAN has an significantly lower variance in response time for medium and heavy workloads. The intuitive reason for this variance is that SCAN tend to favor requests in middle cylinders where as C-versions do not have this imbalance.</p> <p> </p> <p> These algorithms do not schedule to improve rotational latency; therefore, as seek times decrease relative to rotational latency, the performance differences between the algorithms decrease.</p></div>
