<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Shortest Seek Time First</b>(SSTF): It select the request that is nearest to the current head position.</p> <p> <b>Ageing</b> is the mechanism where the priority of the process increases gradually on the basis of its waiting time. If a process does not receive CPU for a long time then aging will occur.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>• <b>Shortest Seek Time First </b>is the best scheduling algorithm as it serves the request that are nearer to the current head position and would be able to take the advantage of the given situation. </p> <p>• Other scheduling algorithm like first come first serve (FCFS) could cause head movement that are unnecessary when frequently visited cylinder were placed far apart from each other.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>• One of the solution can be to place the<b> hot spot</b> in or near the middle of the disk, so that it can be nearer to all the data on average cases. </p> <p>• <b>Modified shortest seek time first scheduling algorithm</b> can be used to avert starvation.</p> <p>• Also, some policy can be added to let the operating system generate a seek to the hot spot whenever the disk sits idle for more than 50ms, as the next request might be there. </p> <p>• This helps in making the operating system busy. Even this helps in preventing ageing for the older request. </p> <p>• With the help of Hotspot each and every request gets an equal importance.</p></div>
