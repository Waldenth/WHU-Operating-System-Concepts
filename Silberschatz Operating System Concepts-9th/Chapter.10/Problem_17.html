<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>RAID level 5 â€“ It is also called as block inter leaved distributed parity, differs from level 4 by spreading data and parity among all N + 1 disks, rather than storing data in N disks and parity in one disk. </p> <p>A parity block cannot store parity for blocks in the same disks, because a disk failure would result in loss of data as well as of parity and hence the loss would not be recoverable.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>RAID 5 avoids the potential over use of a single parity disk that can occur with RAID 4. RAID 5 is most common parity system.</p> <p>a)</p> <p> In order to perform a write operation, parity bits must be changed. Process the following steps:</p> <p>1) Read the parity block. </p> <p>2) Write the new data.</p> <p>3) XOR the old data with the new data.</p> <p>4) Read the old parity from the array.</p> <p>5) Compute the parity for the next set of blocks.</p> <p>6) Write the updated parity back to the array.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>b) In order to perform a write to seven continuous blocks of data, the following are the steps:</p> <p> 1) Read the old data.</p> <p> 2) Write the new data.</p> <p> 3) XOR the old data with the new data.</p> <p> 4) Read the old parity from the array for the seven blocks.</p> <p>5) Compute the parity for the next set of blocks.</p> <p> 6) write the updated parity back to the array (for seven blocks).</p></div>
