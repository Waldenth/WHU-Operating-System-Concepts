<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>A timing problem arises:</b> the program that would do the latency-time orderingneeds to know the number of the sector that would be underneath the head at the timeof I/O service. This information would have to come immediately before servicing theI/O request in order to be accurate. This would require extra communication with theperipheral which would take time, canceling some of the benefit.</p> <p>The disk scheduling algorithms consider only seek times because for modern disks, <b>the rotational latency can be nearly as large as average seek time</b>. It is difficult for the operating system to schedule for improved rotational latency because modern disks do not disclose the physical location of logical blocks. The mapping between logical blocks and physical locations is very complex. </p> <p> We would <b>optimize both seek time and rotational latency</b> by modifying the implementation of disk-scheduling algorithms (such as SSTF, SCAN, and C-SCAN ) as the controller hardware built into the disk drive. If the operating system sends a batch of requests to the controller, the controller can queue them and then schedule them to improve both the seek time and rotational latency.</p></div>
