<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>SSTF Scheduling:</b> </p> <p>In order to maximize the throughput, the following should be done in Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF) Scheduling.</p> <p>• To have the service request possible per unit time.</p> <p>• To maximize the response meantime that is to provide the response rapidly to most of the interactive users.</p> <p>• To minimize the response time variance that is to provide the predictability.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>SSTF scheduling algorithm is basically biased towards the middle of the cylinders same as the SCAN algorithm.</p> <p>As in the SSTF algorithm, the closest value of cylinder is selected first, then it is followed by the middle cylinder and at last, the end of the cylinder disk is served.</p> <p>The head of the disk do tend to be placed away from the disk edge since the center of the disk is probably the location that consists of the smallest average distance to the other tracks.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Thus, due to this the current position of the head divide the cylinders of the disk into two groups.</p> <p>• If some new request arrives and the head is not in the center, thus the new request switches into the group that basically includes the center of the disk.</p> <p>• Thus, the head of the disk moves in its direction.</p></div>
