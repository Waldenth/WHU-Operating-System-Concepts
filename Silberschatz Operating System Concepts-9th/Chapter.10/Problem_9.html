<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>a) None of the disk – scheduling disciplines, except FCFS, is truly fair.</p> <p>This assertion is true because it is based on first – come, first – served it does not provide the fastest services. It is because as this algorithm serves the request that come first it won’t give any priority for new requests though they are less spaced. Thus no starvation.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>b) SCAN is modified to C-SCAN i.e., circular SCAN(C-SCAN). It is designed to provide a more uniform wait time. It essentially treats the cylinders as a circular list that wraps around from the final cylinder to the first one.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> </p> <p>c) Fairness is an important goal in a time-sharing system because it increases the performance of the system. The performance depends heavily on the number and type of requests. Also in order to serve all the requests within less time with respect to newly arriving requests.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>d) Operating system is unfair in servicing I/O request.</p> <p>(i) Demand paging may take priority over application I/O.</p> <p>(ii) If the cache is running out of the pages, then writes are more urgent than reads.</p> <p>(iii) It guarantees the order of a set of disk writes to make the file system robust in the face of system crashes.</p></div>
