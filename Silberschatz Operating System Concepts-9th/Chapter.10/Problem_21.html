<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>300-12-14E</p> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/18a/18a0ed33-23c6-4643-8eec-b71e09744c5b/300-12-14e-i1.png" /> </p> <p>a) Disk drives = 1,000</p> <p> Each has 750,000 hour MTBF</p> <p> Mean time for disks drives = <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/a07/a07e15e7-e5cd-4782-883e-f6a4a39b0826/300-12-14e-i2.png" /></p> <p>= 750 hrs per failure about 31 days or once per month</p> <p> </p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>b) 1: 000 chances of dying between ages 20 & 21 years.</p> <p>Human-hours per failure is 8760(hrs in a year) divided by 0.001 failure, giving a value of about 8,760,000 hours for the MTBF. 8760000 hours equals 1000 years. This tells us nothing about the expected lifetime of a person of age 20.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>c) The MTBF tells nothing about the expected lifetime. Hard disk drives are generally designed to have a lifetime of 5 years. If such a drive truly has a million-hour MTBF, it is very unlikely that the drive will fail during its expected lifetime.</p></div>
