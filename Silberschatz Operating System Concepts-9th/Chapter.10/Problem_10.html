<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>SSDs stands for <b>Solid State Disks</b>. This is a non-volatile memory and it is working just like a hard drive. SSDs<b> </b>have no head to move. SSDs have no seek time and latency. So, they are very fast and chomps less power. </p> <p>• There are many disk scheduling algorithms are there such as <b>FCFS</b>, SSTF,SCAN,C-SCAN,LOOK,C-LOOK. The different disk scheduling algorithms are used to minimize the head movements. </p> <p>• FCFS stands for First come First Serve. This is a very simple scheduling algorithm. It performs according to the request order. There is no starvation found here. </p> <p>• The other scheduling algorithms are based on seek time, variance, latency. Though, <b>SSDs</b> have no head, seek time and latency, it uses the simplest general purpose scheduling algorithm FCFS. </p> <p>If <b>SSDs</b> will use another disk scheduling algorithm, Then, its performance may decrease. So, FCFS is the right scheduling algorithm for SSDs<b>.</b></p></div>
