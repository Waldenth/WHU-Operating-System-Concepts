<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>The advantages of using SSDs over magnetic disk drives are given below:</b> </p> <p>• Data Access is faster on SSDs compared to the hard disk drives.</p> <p>• It uses flash memory and don’t use any moving head. So, it is more consistent and provide enhanced performance than hard disk drives.</p> <p>• It consumes less power.</p> <p>• The Solid State Disks have no moving head. So, this is less noisy. Hard disk drives are somewhat noisy as they have read/write moving head.</p> <p>• It generates less heat than that of the hard disk drives. So. Its lifespan is more and will not damage.</p> <p>• It has no magnetic parts. So, it is not affected by magnetism, but hard disk drives has magnetic parts. So some time data may lost due to magnetism effect.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>The disadvantages of using SSDs over magnetic disk drives are given below:</b> </p> <p>• It has limited storage capacity than that of HDD.</p> <p>• This is very expensive as comapared to magnetic disk drives.</p> <p>• If SSDs are severely used then data maintenance capacity will be minimized.</p></div>
