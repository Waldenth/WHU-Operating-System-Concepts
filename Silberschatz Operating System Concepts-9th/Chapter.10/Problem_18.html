<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>RAID 1 performance can actually be slightly better than a standard disk implementation for read operations. Because the contents of both drives are identical, the array management software is free to select the drive which can most quickly satisfy the request.</p> <p>Since RAID 5 systems work with independent spindles, random I/O is naturally load balanced, making them capable of read performance approaching that of RAID\x110, but with much better reliability. RAID 5 requires only one additional drive to add parity protection, resulting in similar economics.</p></div>
