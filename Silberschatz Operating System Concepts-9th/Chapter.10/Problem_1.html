<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The disk scheduling other than FCFS scheduling is useful in a single user environment. </p> <p>• In a single-user environment, only one process will be executing. </p> <p>• Requests for I/O devices will arrive only from single process. </p> <p>• Therefore, the queues for I/O devices will be usually empty.</p> <p>• In such case, the FCFS scheduling an economical method of disk scheduling.</p> <p>• However, LOOK scheduling algorithm is a better and easy method for disk scheduling.</p> <p>• It is easy to program a LOOK scheduling algorithm. In addition, it will give much better performance when multiple processes are performing I/O operations concurrently.</p></div>
