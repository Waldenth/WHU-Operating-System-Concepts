It is more efficient to reread a page from the file system than first write it to swap space and then reread it from swap space when page is selected for page-out by virtual memory.</p> <p>2. It is efficient to write a page to swap space and reread it from there when the page is forced out of physical memory rather than when the virtual memory page is first created. </p> <p>3. Swap space is only used as a backing store for pages of anonymous memory, which includes memory allocated for the stack, heap and uninitialized data of a process. </p> <p>4. Swap space is used for regions of memory shared by several processes.</p> <p>5. Swap space is limited compared to file system space. So, it is difficult to store both code and data pages in swap space.</p></div>
