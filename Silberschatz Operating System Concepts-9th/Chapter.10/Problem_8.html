<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>RAID level 0 – it refers to disk arrays with striping at the level of blocks but without any redundancy. Since redundancy is not there any data lost can’t be overcomed. So, it is used in high-performance applications where data loss is not critical.</p> <p>RAID level 1 – It refers to disk mirroring. So, it is popular for applications that require high reliability with fast recovery.</p> <p> </p> <p>Mirroring provides high reliability, but it is expensive. Stripping provides high data transfer rate, but it does not improve reliability.</p></div>
