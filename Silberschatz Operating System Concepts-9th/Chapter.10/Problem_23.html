<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>An Operating System (OS) does the following things while allocating the blocks:</p> <p>• If an Operating System has more information regarding to the physical location of blocks on the disks, then it could allocate the blocks for a file geometrically which are close by on the disk.</p> <p>• OS allocates a first block of data to the disk by the above procedure, then allocates the second block of data to the same cylinder of the disk but the surface is different. Because, the disk is rotationally optimal.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Performance improvement of the file-system:</b> </p> <p>The OS allocates blocks of data on the same cylinder of disk with different surfaces because, the disk is rotationally optimal place.</p> <p>As the OS allocates blocks of data on the same cylinder, the data can be accessed easily. Therefore, the cost is minimized, and the file-system performance is improved.</p></div>
