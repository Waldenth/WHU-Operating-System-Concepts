<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Solution:</b> </p> <p>In a single-processor system, the multithreaded solution uses the multiple kernels than a single-threaded solution for better performance because of the <b>following scenarios</b>:</p> <p>• In a single-processor system, when the system <b>suffers a page fault</b> the kernel thread switches into another kernel thread while running the process.</p> <p>• It leaves the time in a useful manner.</p> <p>• Also, for the single-threaded solutions, when the page fault occurs, it is not capable to perform the process on the useful note in the system.</p> <p>• It leads to the <b>waiting time and suffers the events in the process of the system</b>.</p> <p>These are the scenarios does the multithread solutions perform better than the single-thread solutions on a single-processor system.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>For instance,</b> </p> <p>• If the user schedules the process in the kernel threads, if one kernel thread is blocked, it automatically switches to the other.</p> <p>• It is <b>efficient for the system to schedule user level processes to the kernel threads</b>.</p> <p>• For scheduling purposes, some OS assigns the user-level threads to the kernel threads.</p> <p>• Multithreaded solution performs faster on the single-processor system by using kernel threads.</p> <p>• It is <b>much more complicated for the single-threaded solution to achieve</b> the efficiency achieved by the multi-threaded solution.</p> <p>• The advantage that deals are multi-tasking processes in the system.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Two programming examples for the better performance is as follows:</b> </p> <p>1) Sequential programs are not good for candidates for multiprogramming. Calculating individual Tax returns is one of the examples for this type of program.</p> <p>2) The second example can be any shell programs like C-shell or Korn shell. These programs monitor its own working places such as open files, current working directory, and environment variables.</p></div>
