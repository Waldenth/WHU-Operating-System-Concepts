<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Performance implications multiprocessor system and a multithreaded program:</b> </p> <p> <b>a) Kernel </b> <b><</b> <b> Number of processors</b> </p> <p>The scheduler in the system can schedule only one kernel thread at a time to one user level process. Since, the system is many-to-many threading model, many user level processes and kernel threads will be idle.</p> <p>The number of processors is greater than the kernel threads, processes can be mapped to kernel threads which is available and can be accessed quickly. Most of the processors will not be utilized and they will be idle. </p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>b) Kernel </b> <b>=</b> <b> Number of processors</b> </p> <p>The scheduler in the system can schedule one kernel thread at a time to one user level processor. Since, the system is many-to-many threading model, many user level processes and kernel threads will be idle.</p> <p>The number of processors is equal to the kernel threads; hence all the user level processors run concurrently in the kernel threads assuming all kernel threads are free and none of them are blocked. </p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>c) Kernel </b> <b>></b> <b> Number of processors</b> </p> <p>The scheduler in the system can schedule only one kernel thread at a time to one user level process. Since, the system is many-to-many threading model, many user level processes and kernel threads will be idle.</p> <p>The number of processors is lesser than the kernel threads, processes can be mapped to kernel threads which is available and can be accessed quickly. If a kernel thread is busy, the user level processes will be swapped with kernel threads which are idle.</p></div>
