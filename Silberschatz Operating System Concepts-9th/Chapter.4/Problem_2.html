<div class="answer"> <p>Following are the differences between user-level threads and kernel-level threads:</p> <table border="1" style="border-collapse:collapse;"> <tr> <td> <p> <b>User-level threads</b> </p> </td> <td> <p> <b>Kernel-level threads</b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>The existence of user-level threads is unknown to the kernel.</p> </td> <td> <p>The existence of kernel-level threads is known to the kernel.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>User-level threads are managed without kernel support.</p> </td> <td> <p>Kernel-level threads are managed by the operating system.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>User-level threads are faster to create than are kernel-level threads.</p> </td> <td> <p>Kernel-level threads are slower to create than are user-level threads.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>User-level threads are scheduled by the thread library.</p> </td> <td> <p>Kernel-level threads are scheduled by the kernel.</p> </td> </tr> </table> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Circumstances where kernel-level threads are better than user-level threads:</b> </p> <p>• If the kernel is single-threaded, then kernel-level threads are better than user-level threads, because any user-level thread performing a blocking system call will cause the entire process to block, even if other threads are available to run within the application.</p> <p>For example a process P1 has 2 kernel level threads and process P2 has 2 user-level threads. If one thread in P1 gets blocked, its second thread is not affected. But in case of P2 if one thread is blocked (say for I/O), the whole process P2 along with the 2<sup>nd</sup> thread gets blocked.</p> <p>• In a multiprocessor environment, the kernel-level threads are better than user-level threads, because kernel-level threads can run on different processors simultaneously while user-level threads of a process will run on one processor only even if multiple processors are available.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Circumstances where user-level threads are better than kernel-level threads:</b> </p> <p>• If the kernel is time shared, then user-level threads are better than kernel-level threads, because in time shared systems context switching takes place frequently. Context switching between kernel level threads has high overhead, almost the same as a process whereas context switching between user-level threads has almost no overhead as compared to kernel level threads.</p></div>
