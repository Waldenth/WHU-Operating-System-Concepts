<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Threads count depends upon the priority and requirements of the application. So only thread is enough for this kind of application and this thread is going to handle both input and output operation. </p> <p>• It is a concurrency approach. Here, it only make sense to create as many threads as there are blocking system calls, as the threads will be spent blocking. </p> <p>• It doesn’t provides any benefits to create an additional threads. </p> <p>Thus, <b>only a single thread creation makes sense for input and a single thread for output.</b></p> <p> <b> </b> </p> <p> <b>Four threads are created</b> to perform the CPU-intensive portion of the application. It is because, there should be as many threads as there are processing cores.</p> <p>• It would be the waste of processing resources to use fewer threads.</p> <p>• Also any number greater than four would be unable to run.</p></div>
