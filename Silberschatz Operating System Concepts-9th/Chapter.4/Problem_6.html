<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>The </b> <b>programming examples in which multithreading do </b> <b>not </b> <b>provide better performance than a single-threaded solution is as follows:</b> </p> <p>• In the linear programming, the multithreading does not provide better performance than a single-threaded solution. In the single-threaded solution, the linear programing has better performance. Programs like, computing the factorial of a number, sorting numbers, and minimizing the linear equations provide better performance using the single thread.</p> <p>• The multithreading does not provide better performance in the “shell programs”. The shell programs use the single thread to execute the program. C-shell and Korn shell programs do not provide better performance in multithreading. </p></div>
