<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Unique processes created by the given code segment:</b> </p> <p>The fork() system call allows a parent process to create a new process call child process.</p> <p>• The statement pid = fork();before the if statement creates one process. The parent process say p0 creates this process. Let it be p1.</p> <p>• The statement fork();in the if statement creates one process. The parent process p1 creates this process. Let it be p2.</p> <p>• After the if statement, parent process p0, process p1 and process p2 will execute fork(); creating three new processes.</p> <p>o One process is created by parent process p0.</p> <p>o One process is created by process p1.</p> <p>o One process is created by process p2.</p> <p>• Let the three new processes created by p0, p1, and p2 are p4, p5, and p6.</p> <p>Therefore, 6 unique processes (p0, p1, p2, p3, p4, p1, p5) will be created. </p> <p>Hence, the number of unique processes created are <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/1ce/1cebd1d7-7608-4b7d-9848-8bea8ff8ddae/13258-4-15E-i1.png" />.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Unique threads</b> <b>created by the given code segment:</b></p> <p>• Thread creation is done in if block by the function pthread_create(). Only child process p1 is executed in the if block. Therefore, process p1 will create one thread.</p> <p>• In the if block one process p2 is created using fork(). Therefore, process p2 will also create a thread.</p> <p>Hence, the number of unique threads created are <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/8b8/8b8fc364-5632-4cf0-bdbc-debc2f470c14/13258-4-15E-i2.png" />.</p></div>
