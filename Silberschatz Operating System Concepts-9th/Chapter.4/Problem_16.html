<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Threads and processes in Linux:</b> </p> <p>Linux operating systems consider both threads and processes as tasks; it cannot able to distinguish between them. In contrast, windows operating system threads and processes differently.</p> <p>This approach has pros and cons while modelling threads and processes inside the kernel.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Pros:</b> </p> <p>• Linux consider this as similar, so codes belong to operating system can be cut down easily.</p> <p>• Scheduler present in the Linux operating systems do not need special code to test threads coupled with each processes.</p> <p>• It considers different threads and processes as a single task during the time of scheduling.</p> <p> <b>Cons:</b> </p> <p>• This ability makes it harder for the Linux operating system to inflict process-wide resource limitations directly.</p> <p>• Extra steps are needed to recognize the each processes belong to appropriate threads and complexity in performing relevant tasks.</p></div>
