<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Threads with real time system</b> </p> <p>In an application which is based on real time processing, time plays an important role for execution. Threads are the parts of the process and also known as light weight process (LWP).</p> <p>When a thread is noticeable as the thread of real time but a Light weight process is not bounded with this thread, then, the thread must have to be waiting for the attachment of LWP.</p> <p>When a LWP is attached to any thread, the priority of that thread becomes higher. So, in a condition of dead lock, if a thread is having LWP, the thread has a minimum waiting time for the execution and time is saved. Thus, it can be said that the LWP attached thread is required in the real time systems.</p></div>
