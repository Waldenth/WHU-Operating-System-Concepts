<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Kernel:</b> </p> <p>• Kernel is the head of any operating system. </p> <p>• Several threads with different tasks are executed by the kernel.</p> <p>• The interrupts generated by multi-threading are handled by kernel.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>The Role of kernel in threading are as follows:</b> </p> <p>When a context switch is occurred among the threads of kernel level, the kernel suspends all the threads and their respective values from the registers of the central processing unit (CPU). The newly scheduled threads restore the values in the registers.</p> <p>Thus, due to this the current process state is also saved as well as the state og the incoming processes can also be restored.</p> <p>For a kernel, the execution time is the main issue. If the new processes are created for the execution, rather than threads, it becomes more time consuming. So, the context stored in the registers of the CPU is switched.</p></div>
