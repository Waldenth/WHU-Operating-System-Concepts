So, creating either a user or kernel thread involves allocating a small data structure to hold a thread ID, a program counter, a register set, stack and priority, whereas creating a process involves allocating the large data structure called as PCB(Process Control Block) which includes a memory map, list of open files, and environment variables. Allocating and managing the memory map is typically the most time-consuming activity. </p> <p>Resources are used when a thread is created: </p> <p> 1. Code section</p> <p> 2. Data section and </p> <p> 3. Other operation system resources such as open files and signals with other threads belonging to the same process whereas each and every process has separate code section, data section and operating system resources.</p> <p>Â </p></div>
