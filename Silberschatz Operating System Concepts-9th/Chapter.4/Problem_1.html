<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Multithreading in programming languages</b> </p> <p>To execute any application program, a number of threads (light weight processes) are used. This is done, because if any single thread is blocked, the application will not stop. Most of the programming languages uses the concept of multithreading. The examples to show the use of multithreading in programming languages are as given below:</p> <p>• In a web server environment, a number of users request for the application. Thus, when any application is executed through the web server, a number of different threads are executed for different users.</p> <p>• In graphic user interface, different threads are executed for different tasks. For example, first thread is used to fix the bugs, the second thread is responsible for the execution of the program and another one is responsible for the performance of the program.</p> <p>If any program is executed using only one thread, then, if that thread is blocked, the total application will stop responding. So, it can be said that the performance of multi-threading is much better than system with single thread.</p></div>
