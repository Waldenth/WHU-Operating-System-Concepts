<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Thread cancellation</b> </p> <p>Thread cancellation is a process of cancelling thread before its completion. Thread cancellation leads to termination of the executing thread in the process.To cancel a thread, below given functions are used:</p> <p>• Inorder to cancel thread, pthread_cancel() function is used.</p> <p>• pthread_cancel() functions depends on pthread_setcancelstate() function.</p> <p>• To cancel thread immediately PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS type is set.</p> <p>• The default cancellation type is PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERED which means thread is cancelled only when it reaches its termination point.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Thread cancellation state and type</b> </p> <p>Thread cancellation state and type determine when the thread cancellation request is placed. There are two states in thread cancellation:</p> <p>• PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE in all cancellation state are held pending.</p> <p>• PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE in which cancellations requests are acted on according to thread cancellation types.</p> <p>• The default thread cancellation type is PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Thread cancellation points</b> </p> <p>The system test for pending cancellation requests in certain blocking functions, if cancellation function is ENABLED and its type is DEFERED. These points are known as cancellation points.</p> <p>pthread_testcancel() function is used to create cancellation points.</p></div>
