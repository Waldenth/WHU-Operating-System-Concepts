<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Processes</b> and <b>threads</b> both can typically be defined as sequences of execution, for any program. The main difference lies beneath the memory space they share on the RAM or main memory of the system while getting executed. </p> <p>• Each process acquires a unique address space on the memory; whereas threads of a program usually share the same memory space for their execution.</p> <p>• Processes act independently while threads always remain dependent on their consequent thread for their execution. Threads remain a chain of instructions where a small breakdown may terminate the entire execution.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Google Chrome Browser maintains to open each new website as an independent process rather than opening them as threads to ensure that no website breakdown affects others’ service. </p> <p>One cannot maintain the efficiency of the browser while opening each new website as a thread, because threads are allocated with shared memory spaces. Hence they may affect each other if one of them crashes unexpectedly.</p></div>
