<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Thus, a multithreaded system which has multiple user-level threads, cannot use different processors in multiprocessor system at the same time. Only a single process is visible to the operating system and the different threads of the process, present on separate processors are not scheduled.</p> <p>Thus, on executing multiple user-level threads on multiprocessor system, no performance benefit occurs.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Thus, user level threads cannot take advantage of multiple processors. They would perform the same.</p></div>
