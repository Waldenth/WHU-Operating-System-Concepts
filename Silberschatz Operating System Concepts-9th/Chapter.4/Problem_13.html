<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Refer to the question provided in Exercise 4.21 for defining the answer for part (a).</p> <p>Refer to the Project 1 provided in chapter 4 for defining the answer of part (b).</p> <p>Refer to the Project 2 provided in chapter 4 for defining the answer of part (b).</p> <p>Refer to the multithreaded web server provided in Section 4.1.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Task Parallelism:</b> The task or thread is allocated across the multiple computing cores and each thread operates different operation.</p> <p> <b>Data Parallelism:</b> The subset of same data is allocated across the multiple computing cores and each core operates same operation on those data.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>a)</p> <p>• Here, multiple threads are created and each thread will perform its dedicated task.</p> <p>• For example, first thread is assigned to calculate average for all the numbers in the list.</p> <p>• Whereas, second thread is performing the function to find minimum value and third thread is assigned to calculate maximum value in the program.</p> <p>• <b>Hence, the problem exhibits Task Parallelism.</b></p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>b)</p> <p>• In Sudoku validator example, there are constraints that each row or column should contain the digits from 1 to 9. And each grid should have digits from 1 to 9 in its column, row and subgrids without repetitions. </p> <p>• So, in this problem, different threads will perform the same task of checking digits from 1 to 9 but they will do this for different content.</p> <p>• <b>Hence, the problem exhibits Data Parallelism.</b></p> </div>
<h2>Step-5</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>c)</p> <p>• Here, in sorting list, the list is divided in two halves by threads from process. Then, those two separate threads run concurrently and execute individually to generate two sorted sub lists from the global/original list. Thus, here it is using data parallelism.</p> <p>• Then, third thread is also used which is combining the two sorted lists into single sorted list. Here, it is using task parallelism.</p> <p>• Hence, this can be interpreted as the example of hybrid parallelism, that is, <b>it is using both data parallelism and task parallelism.</b></p> </div>
<h2>Step-6</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>d)</p> <p>• As described, the multithreaded web server creates different threads in such a way that each thread is dedicated to perform a specific task. This leads to better performance of the server. </p> <p>• For example, threads for tasks like receiving the requests of clients and completing those requests exists separately.</p> <p>• <b>Hence, the problem exhibits Task Parallelism.</b></p></div>
