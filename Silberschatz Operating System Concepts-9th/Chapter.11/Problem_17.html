<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>File sharing by maintaining a single copy:</b> </p> <p>A user performs different modifications to the file which is a single copy of file sharing, then the user may not obtain the correct data of a file after concurrent updates.</p> <p>Because, the file sharing with a single copy of the file will not be updated concurrently. It will result an incorrect information obtained by the user. Then the file is being left in incorrect state and the user may not obtain the appropriate information.</p> <p> <b>Merits of a single copy of file sharing:</b> </p> <p>• No wastage of memory, because the data is stored in a single file.</p> <p>• More number of users can access the single file.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>File sharing by maintaining multiple copies:</b> </p> <p>File sharing with multiple copies allows multiple user to access and share the files. Therefore, multiple users can perform different operations like writing to a file, deleting a file etc. </p> <p>As multiple users can access multiple copies of files, the data in the file may be inconsistent and with respect to each other. </p> <p> <b>Merits of multiple copies of file sharing:</b> </p> <p>• It is more efficient than maintaining a single copy.</p> <p>• Wastage of memory by maintaining multiple copies same file.</p> <p>• Data is inconsistent.</p></div>
