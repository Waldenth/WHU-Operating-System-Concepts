<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/d5f/d5f1fca9-1139-4bff-8c8f-09da7f411acf/13258-11-10E-i1.png" /> </b> <b>, </b>the operating system does not maintain the separate table to maintain the files for each and every user instead it just maintain the central open-file table which contains the accessed references to files by users at present time.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Reason:</b> </p> <p>The central open-file table is used to maintain the details of currently opened files references.</p> <p>• So, the files can be accessed by more than one process at same time.</p> <p>• If one process removes the files then it should not be removed until all processes file accessing have stopped it.</p> <p>• This verification can be done only when more than one process accessing the file.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/eb2/eb2d6b10-8875-4fa6-9e01-68bb7d7386cb/13258-11-10E-i2.png" />, the operating systems should be maintaining the separate entries for two processes in open-file table.</p> <p> <b>Reason:</b> </p> <p>When more than one process accessing the files, then it maintain the separate states to track the current location of files accessing by more than one process.</p> <p>• So, accessing the same files by two different processes should maintain the separate states to track the details that is, which parts of files can be accessed by two processes.</p></div>
