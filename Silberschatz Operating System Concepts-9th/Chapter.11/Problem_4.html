<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>2481-10-11E SA: 8683</p> <p> SR: 6376</p> <p> <b>Yes</b>, we can simulate a multilevel directory structure with a single-level directory structure which uses arbitrarily large file names. Each directory name can essentially be appended to the primary file name. This can be done by using the character “.” to indicate the end of a subdirectory. For example, the name <i>user1</i><i>.test.file1 </i>specifies that <i>file</i><i>1 </i>is a file in subdirectory <i>test </i>which in turn is in the root directory <i>user1</i>. </p> <p>In contrast with the multilevel directory scheme, which doesn’t allow local user files to be accessed by other users, this scheme allows to access files of other users by specifying their complete search path. </p> <p> </p> <p> However, the scheme will fail if the length of the file names is restricted to seven characters. Then the answer would be no. We cannot simulate a multilevel directory structure with a single-level directory structure.<b> </b></p></div>
