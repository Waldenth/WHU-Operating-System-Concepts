<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Let file1 be the old file and file2 be the new file. A user wishing to access file1 through an existing link will actually access file2. Note that the access protection for file file1 is used rather than the one associated with file2. This problem can be avoided by ensuring that all links to a deleted file are deleted also. This can be accomplished in several ways:</p> <p>a. Maintain a list of all links to a file, removing each of them when the file is deleted. </p> <p> b. Retain the links, removing them when an attempt is made to access a deleted file. </p> <p> c. Maintain a file reference list (or counter), deleting the file only after all links or ref-erences to that file have been deleted.</p></div>
