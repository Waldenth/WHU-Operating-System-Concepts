The operating system keeps a small table, called the open-file table, containing information about all open files. The open() operation takes a file name and searches the directory, copying the directory entry into the open-file table. The open() call can also accept access mode information-create, read-only, read-write, append-only, and so on. This mode is checked against the file`s permissions. If the request mode is allowed, the file is opened for the process. The open() system call typically returns a pointer to the entry in the open-file table.</p> <p> If the process completes its operation on a given file then it issue a <b>close()</b> system call. The <b>close()</b> call decreases the open count, which could be associated with each file to indicate how many processes have the file open. When open count reaches the zero, the file is no longer in use, and the file entry is removed from the open-file table.</p></div>
