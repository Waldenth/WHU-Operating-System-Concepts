For instance, the user can create/delete an entry in the directory without actually creating/deleting the file. The file would continue to exist in the file-system but would be “hidden” as it would not be visible in a directory.</p> <p> <b>Protection:</b> The user can change the file permissions either accidentally or maliciously thereby authorizing unauthorized users access to the file.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>b)</p> <p>To deal with the protection problems, the operating system should ensure that the user modifies directory structures in a controlled and disciplined manner. It should<b> </b>not allow user to write directly onto the subdirectory, rather provide some system operation to do so. This could be done having specific calls such as create, delete, chmod etc to modify the entries in the directory and the information associated with each entry in the directory.</p></div>
