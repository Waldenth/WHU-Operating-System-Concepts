<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>File:</b> </p> <p>• A file is a collection of data or some information saved on secondary storage using a filename. </p> <p>• A file name is given to a file for faster accesses. There are many different types of files like data files, text files, program file and so on.</p> <p>• The file name is given by the creator of the file. </p> <p>• A file has a well-defined structure, which depend on its <i>type</i>.</p> <p>• The <i>file type </i>is specified by splitting the name of the file into two parts,</p> <p>o A name</p> <p>o An extension</p> <p>• For examples: program.java, address.docx, feedback.xlsm</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The interpretation on the type of the file changes from system to system.</p> <p>• There are certain systems in which operations on files depends on the type of the file. </p> <p>• There are other systems where the interpretation of a files data is left to the process and does not provide any help in the accessing the data.</p> <p>• The system that is “better” depends on the needs of the processes on the system, and the demands the users place on the operating system. </p> <p>• If a system is working mostly on database applications, it is efficient for the operating system to implement a database type file and provide operations.</p> <p>• Some systems do not implement multiple file types, because this keeps the operating system size smaller and it must contain code to support different file structures to support different file types. </p></div>
