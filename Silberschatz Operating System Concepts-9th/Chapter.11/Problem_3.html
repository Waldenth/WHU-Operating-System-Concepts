<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Files</b> </p> <p>The <b>advantage</b> of a system supporting a variety of file structures is that there is no requirement of an application supporting each file structure. The system itself is sufficient for supporting different file structures. This also implies that the support provided by the system is much more efficient as compared to the support provided by applications.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> A possible <b>disadvantage</b> of this approach is increased size of the system to be efficient enough to provide support for different file structures. Moreover, different applications may need some file types which are not supported by the system altogether. Thus, they may fail to run on these systems. </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>On the other hand, an alternative approach, followed by systems such as UNIX, which treats all files as a byte stream is <b>advantageous</b> in terms of simplicity. Since all files are treated as a stream of bytes, different supports are not required for different file structures which simplify the task of the operating system. The application itself takes the charge of file definition required.</p></div>
