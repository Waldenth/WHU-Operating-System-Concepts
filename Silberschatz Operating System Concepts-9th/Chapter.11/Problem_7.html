<div class="answer"> <p> <b>b</b>) </p> <p> <b>The following scheme can be more effective for the given purpose than the scheme provided by UNIX.</b> </p> <p> The problem with the above scheme is the length of the access control list is large. Constructing such a list may be a tedious or unrewarding task, especially if we do not know in advance the list of users in the system. </p> <p> In the new scheme, we would create an access-control list with no access privileges allowed and then we will add remaining ten users to this list. The universal access to files applies to all users who are not listed in access control list. In this scheme the length of the list is reduced.</p></div>
