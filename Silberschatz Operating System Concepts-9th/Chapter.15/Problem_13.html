<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Constraining the set of potential senders of a message is called authentication. If <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/ab9/ab95030c-4507-451a-9055-c7b57206c690/300-15-13e-i1.png" /> produces a valid message, then we know that the creator of the message must hold<img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/756/756b8b31-febb-4b9c-a7de-a0987612bf7d/300-15-13e-i2.png" />. But given is<img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/f82/f82f34e2-fe89-41e1-9cf5-0003351b4051/300-15-13e-i3.png" />, this means that <img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/159/1590d4c3-b6e3-4ff6-b360-675bae8a19bb/300-15-13e-i4.png" /> is not held by the sender. Thus it does not provide authentication of the sender. This is used when both sender and receiver know each others keys.</p></div>
