<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Man-in-the-middle attacks:</b> </p> <p>Any <b>protocol</b> that requires a sender and a receiver to agree on a session key before they start communicating are prone to the man-in-the-middle attacks.</p> <p>• <b>For instance,</b> if the two communicating systems is communicating with a common session key.</p> <p>• If the protocol messages for exchanging the session key are not protected by the appropriate authentication mechanism, then it is possible for an attacker to manufacture a session key and get access to the data being communicated between the two parties.</p> <p>• And also it is possible by using the fake session keys with the client and server interaction.</p> <p>• When the attacker receives the data from the client, it can decrypt the data, re-encrypts it with the original key from the server, and transmit the encrypted data to the server without alerting either the client or the server about the attacker’s presence.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>For example, the most known attacks is a Virus,</b> </p> <p>Virus is a self-replicating and is designed to infect other programs. </p> <p>• A virus is a fragment of code embedded in a legitimate program.</p> <p>• <b>Virus</b> is borne via email, with spam the most common vector. </p> <p>• They can also spread when users download viral program from the internet, file-sharing services or exchange infected disks.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-3</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Methods to prevent the man-in-the-middle attacks:</b> </p> <p>The methods to remove attacks are,</p> <p>• Port Scanning</p> <p>• Denial of service attacks</p> <p> <b>For instance,</b> </p> <p>• The person who wants to send out the public key, but attackers also sends the “bad” public key. </p> <p>• The person who wants to send the encrypted message knows no better and so uses the bad key to encrypt the message. </p> <p>• Thus, the attacker then happily decrypts it.</p> </div>
<h2>Step-4</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The problems can be solved by using <b>Digital Signature</b>.</p> <p> <b>Digital Signature </b>is used to authenticate messages from the server.</p> <p>• If the server could communicate the session key and its identity in a message that is guarded by a digital signature granted by a certifying authority.</p> <p>• So, the attacker would not able to forge the session key.</p> <p> <b>Therefore, the man-in-the-middle attacks could be avoided by using digital signatures.</b> </p></div>
