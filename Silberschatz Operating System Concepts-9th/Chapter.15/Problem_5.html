<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>By using watchdog, implementations can quickly detect transport and application layer failures and with watchdog messages they can enable failover from a peer that has failed. Watchdog is designed to detect failures of the immediate peer.</p> <p>If any watchdog response is pending then failover is initiated to the connection. As failover mechanism initiates, all queued messages are sent using alternate connection, and therefore duplicate connection is needed.</p></div>
