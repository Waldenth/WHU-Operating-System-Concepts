<div class="answer"> <p>A worm is a process that uses the spawn mechanism to ravage system performance. The worm spawns copies of itself, using up system resources and perhaps locking out all other processes. On computer network, worms are particularly potent, since they may reproduce themselves among systems and thus shutdown the entire network.</p> <p> The worm was made up of two programs, a grappling look (also called as bootstrap or vector) program and main program.</p> <p> A firewall is a computer or router that sits between the systems and internet. It limits network access between the two security domains and monitors and logs all connection. It can also limit connections based on source or destination address, source or destination part or direction of the connections. It filters the packets moving from one side to the other, assuring that only valid packets owned by authorized users are allowed to access the protect systems. Such firewalls usually make use of the system less convenient.</p></div>
