<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Hardware Support</b> </p> <p>A hardware support is one that places a guarantee regarding the buffer overflow attack that it doesn’t take place and prevents the code execution that is located within the segment of stack of the address space of the process.</p> <p>Next recall the attack of the buffer-overflow which is performed by the overflow of the buffer that is present on the frame of the stack, next it jumps on to the another frame of the stack where the malicious executable code is present and returns the address of the function thus result in the buffer overflow. Thus, by code execution prevention from the stacks segment this problem could be eliminated.</p> <p>Most of the approaches use various methodologies of programming that are built typically around the use of validation of bounds that guard it against the overflow of buffer. The condition of buffer overflows doesn’t occur in the languages like the java where each of the array access is confidential and guaranteed with the software check bounds. </p> <p>Thus, these types of approaches don’t require the support of hardware but results in the costs runtime.</p></div>
