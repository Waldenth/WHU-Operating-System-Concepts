<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>The use of asymmetric encryption begins with the publication of the public key of the destination. For bidirectional communication, the source also must publish its public key. The private key must be guarded, as anyone holding that key can decrypt any message created by matching public key. Asymmetric algorithms are used only for the purpose of small amounts of data but also for authentication, confidentially, and key distribution.</p> <p>The critical property that an authentication algorithm must possess is as follows:</p> <p>For a message <i>m,</i> a computer can generate an authenticator <i>a</i><i><img src="https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/e16/e16d22a3-ad12-477c-b64e-00baf3f48dd8/300-15-14e-i1.png" /></i><i>A</i> such that V(<i>k</i>)(<i>m</i>,<i>a</i>)=<i>true</i> only if it possesses S(<i>k</i>) where K is a set of keys, M is a set of messages, A is a set of Authenticators. Thus a computer holding S(<i>k</i>) can generate authenticators on messages so that any other computer possessing V(<i>k</i>) can verify them. This states that the receiver knows that only the sender could have generated the message and only the receiver can decrypt the massage.</p> <p>Thus both Authentication and Secrecy are obtained.</p></div>
