<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> One method of improving system security is periodically to scan the system for security holes. A scan can check a variety of aspects of the system.</p> <p>The COPS program itself could be modified by an intruder to disable some of its features or even to take advantage of its features to create new security flaws. Even if COPS is not cracked, it is possible for an intruder to gain a copy of COPS, study it, and locate security breaches which COPS does not detect. Then that intruder could prey on systems in which the management depends on COPS for security, when all COPS is providing is complacency. COPS could be stored on a read only media or file system to avoid its modification. It could only be provided to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. Neither of these is a foolproof solution, however.</p></div>
