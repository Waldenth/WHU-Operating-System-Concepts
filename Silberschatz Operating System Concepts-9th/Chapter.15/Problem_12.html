<h2>Step-1</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p> <b>Encryption Schemes</b> </p> <p>The comparison between the Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption Schemes is given as:</p> <table border="1" style="border-collapse:collapse;"> <tr> <td> <p> <b>S.No.</b> </p> </td> <td> <p> <b>Symmetric Encryption</b> </p> </td> <td> <p> <b>Asymmetric Encryption</b> </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>1.</p> </td> <td> <p>In this encryption scheme only single and same key is used for both encryption and decryption purposes.</p> </td> <td> <p>In this encryption scheme different keys are used for both encryption and decryption.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>2.</p> </td> <td> <p>It includes commonly used encryption standard algorithm called as DES that is data-encryption standard and includes an advanced encryption standards (AES).</p> </td> <td> <p>It includes an asymmetric algorithm named as RSA or Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman algorithm. </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>3.</p> </td> <td> <p>Symmetric encryption includes a 64-bit chunk that includes messages that are broken into 64 bits thus include block cipher.</p> </td> <td> <p>Asymmetric encryption algorithm includes two keys namely a public key and a private key for encryption and decryption.</p> </td> </tr> </table> </div>
<h2>Step-2</h2>
<div class="answer"> <p>Asymmetric schemes of key cryptography are based basically on the foundation of mathematics that helps in providing the guarantee for the reverse engineering intractability of the encryption schemes. As these schemes is expensive as compared to the symmetric encryption scheme.</p> <p>Thus, due to the vast superiority usage of Asymmetric schemes, this scheme is used for various other purposes of providing the security that is confidentiality, key distribution, and authentication, thus a distributed system will use asymmetric encryption scheme much more.</p></div>
